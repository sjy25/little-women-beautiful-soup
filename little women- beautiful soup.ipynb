      "\n",
      "\"We've got Father and Mother, and each other,\" said Beth contentedly\n",
      "from her corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\n",
      "cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, \"We haven't got\n",
      "Father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She didn't say\n",
      "\"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far\n",
      "away, where the fighting was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, \"You know\n",
      "the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was\n",
      "because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we\n",
      "ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in\n",
      "the army.  We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\n",
      "ought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,\" and Meg shook her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've\n",
      "each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\n",
      "that.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\n",
      "to buy Undine and Sintran for myself.  I've wanted it so long,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\n",
      "like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\n",

      "fly out the window or cry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\n",
      "tidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\n",
      "get so stiff, I can't practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\n",
      "rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don't\n",
      "have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\n",
      "don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\n",
      "father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\n",

      "\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's\n",

      "\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\n",

      "spite of their money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\n",
      "we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\n",
      "the long figure stretched on the rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\n",
      "such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\n",
      "\"pecking\" ended for that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\n",
      "lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\n",
      "boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so\n",
      "much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\n",
      "your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\n",
      "tails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\n",
      "a chestnut mane.  \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\n",
      "March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It's\n",
      "bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and\n",
      "manners!  I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And\n",
      "it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And\n",
      "I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like\n",
      "castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Jo!  It's too bad, but it can't be helped.  So you must try to be\n",
      "contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\n",
      "girls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the\n",
      "dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its\n",
      "touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular\n",
      "and prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected\n",
      "little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and\n",
      "refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant.  But your\n",
      "absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\n",
      "ready to share the lecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly, and no one\n",
      "contradicted her, for the 'Mouse' was the pet of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "As young readers like to know 'how people look', we will take this\n",
      "moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\n",
      "knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\n",
      "without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable\n",
      "room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a\n",
      "good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\n",
      "chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\n",
      "pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\n",
      "plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet\n",
      "mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\n",
      "Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she\n",
      "never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\n",
      "much in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\n",
      "gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\n",
      "funny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it\n",
      "was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders\n",
      "had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the\n",
      "uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\n",
      "woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,\n",
      "was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\n",
      "manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom\n",
      "disturbed.  Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the\n",
      "name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of\n",
      "her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.\n",
      "Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own\n",
      "opinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow\n",
      "hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying\n",
      "herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters\n",
      "of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\n",
      "of slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a\n",
      "good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone\n",
      "brightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the\n",
      "lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot\n",
      "how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the\n",
      "blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair.\"\n",

      "of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for\n",
      "he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth, \"let's each get her something\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's like you, dear!  What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\n",

      "\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won't cost\n",
      "much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\n",
      "Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair\n",
      "with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\n",
      "presents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\n",
      "dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\"\n",
      "said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then\n",
      "surprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so\n",
      "much to do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up\n",
      "and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mean to act any more after this time.  I'm getting too old for\n",
      "such things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\n",
      "'dressing-up' frolics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\n",
      "with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\n",
      "actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\n",
      "boards,\" said Jo.  \"We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and\n",
      "do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose to make\n",
      "myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down\n",
      "easily, I'll drop.  If I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\n",
      "graceful.  I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\"\n",
      "returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen\n",
      "because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain\n",
      "of the piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\n",
      "crying frantically, 'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'\" and away went Jo,\n",
      "with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and\n",
      "jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her \"Ow!\" was\n",
      "more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.\n",
      "Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let\n",
      "her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. \"It's no use!  Do\n",
      "the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don't\n",
      "blame me.  Come on, Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech\n",
      "of two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an\n",
      "awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird\n",
      "effect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in\n",
      "agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, \"Ha! Ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the best we've had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\n",
      "rubbed his elbows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.\n",
      "You're a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that\n",
      "her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly.  \"I do think The Witches Curse, an\n",
      "Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try\n",
      "Macbeth, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do\n",
      "the killing part.  'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\" muttered\n",
      "Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous\n",
      "tragedian do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of the\n",
      "bread.  Beth's stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\n",
      "general burst of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\n",
      "and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a\n",
      "'can I help you' look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\n",
      "elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\n",
      "gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\n",
      "the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,\n",
      "getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home to\n",
      "dinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look\n",
      "tired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things\n",
      "off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy\n",
      "to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The\n",
      "girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own\n",
      "way.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,\n",
      "dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth\n",
      "trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy\n",
      "gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\n",
      "happy face, \"I've got a treat for you after supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth\n",
      "clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up\n",
      "her napkin, crying, \"A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through\n",
      "the cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving\n",
      "wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry and get done!  Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper\n",
      "over your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her\n",
      "bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\n",
      "over the delight to come, till the others were ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too\n",
      "old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\n",
      "warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan—what's its name?  Or a\n",
      "nurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\n",
      "bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\n",
      "her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his\n",
      "work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\n",
      "minute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her\n",
      "feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\n",
      "the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\n",
      "should happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those\n",
      "hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent\n",
      "home.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the\n",
      "dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,\n",
      "hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and\n",
      "military news, and only at the end did the writer's heart over-flow\n",
      "with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them\n",
      "by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their\n",
      "affection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see\n",
      "them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these\n",
      "hard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to\n",
      "them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty\n",
      "faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves\n",
      "so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and\n",
      "prouder than ever of my little women.\" Everybody sniffed when they came\n",
      "to that part.  Jo wasn't ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the\n",
      "end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she\n",
      "hid her face on her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, \"I am a selfish\n",
      "girl!  But I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in\n",
      "me by-and-by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We all will,\" cried Meg.  \"I think too much of my looks and hate to\n",
      "work, but won't any more, if I can help it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman' and not be\n",
      "rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\n",
      "else,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\n",
      "harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and\n",
      "began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\n",
      "lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\n",
      "that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\n",
      "coming home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\n",
      "cheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress\n",
      "when you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have\n",
      "me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and\n",
      "sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from\n",
      "the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,\n",
      "where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\n",
      "Celestial City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\n",
      "passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,\"\n",
      "said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\n",
      "and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\n",
      "top.  If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\n",
      "over again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\n",
      "at the mature age of twelve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\n",
      "playing all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our\n",
      "road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\n",
      "guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\n",
      "which is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\n",
      "begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can\n",
      "get before Father comes home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\n",
      "literal young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather\n",
      "think she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have.  Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\n",
      "pianos, and being afraid of people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but\n",
      "nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully.  \"It is only another name for\n",
      "trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to\n",
      "be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled\n",
      "us out as Help did in the book.  We ought to have our roll of\n",
      "directions, like Christian.  What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo,\n",
      "delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull\n",
      "task of doing her duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your\n",
      "guidebook,\" replied Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then\n",
      "out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the\n",
      "girls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but\n",
      "tonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long\n",
      "seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,\n",
      "and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they\n",
      "talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.\n",
      "No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had\n",
      "a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant\n",
      "accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a\n",
      "flute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a\n",
      "cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\n",
      "coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the\n",
      "most pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could\n",
      "lisp...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,\n",
      "\n",
      "and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\n",
      "The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the\n",
      "house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same\n",
      "cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\n",
      "lullaby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\n",
      "stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\n",
      "disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down\n",
      "because it was crammed so full of goodies.  Then she remembered her\n",
      "mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a\n",
      "little crimson-covered book.  She knew it very well, for it was that\n",
      "beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it\n",
      "was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey.  She woke\n",
      "Meg with a \"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her\n",
      "pillow.  A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,\n",
      "and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present\n",
      "very precious in their eyes.  Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage\n",
      "and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and\n",
      "all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy\n",
      "with the coming day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\n",
      "which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved\n",
      "her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently\n",
      "given.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her\n",
      "to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"Mother wants\n",
      "us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.\n",
      "We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all\n",
      "this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.  You can\n",
      "do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a\n",
      "little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good\n",
      "and help me through the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she opened her new book and began to read.  Jo put her arm round\n",
      "her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\n",
      "so seldom seen on her restless face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How good Meg is!  Come, Amy, let's do as they do.  I'll help you with\n",
      "the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\n",
      "whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her\n",
      "sisters' example.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy.  and then the rooms were very still\n",
      "while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\n",
      "touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\n",
      "their gifts, half an hour later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness only knows.  Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma\n",
      "went straight off to see what was needed.  There never was such a woman\n",
      "for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah,\n",
      "who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by\n",
      "them all more as a friend than a servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything\n",
      "ready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\n",
      "basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper\n",
      "time.  \"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the\n",
      "little flask did not appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\n",
      "it, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take\n",
      "the first stiffness off the new army slippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?  Hannah washed and ironed\n",
      "them for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\n",
      "at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless the child!  She's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\n",
      "March'.  How funny!\" cried Jo, taking one up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that right?  I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\n",
      "initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,\"\n",
      "said Beth, looking troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for\n",
      "no one can ever mistake now.  It will please her very much, I know,\"\n",
      "said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's Mother.  Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed\n",
      "and steps sounded in the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\n",
      "all waiting for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\n",
      "surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\n",
      "early.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't laugh at me, Jo!  I didn't mean anyone should know till the time\n",
      "came.  I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I\n",
      "gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\n",
      "more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\n",
      "one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\n",
      "herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her 'a\n",
      "trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\n",
      "ornament the stately bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\n",
      "being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\n",
      "minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\n",
      "girls to the table, eager for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas, Marmee!  Many of them!  Thank you for our books.  We\n",
      "read some, and mean to every day,\" they all cried in chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas, little daughters!  I'm glad you began at once, and\n",
      "hope you will keep on.  But I want to say one word before we sit down.\n",
      "Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.\n",
      "Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they\n",
      "have no fire.  There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy\n",
      "came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold.  My girls, will\n",
      "you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\n",
      "minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, \"I'm\n",
      "so glad you came before we began!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\n",
      "Beth eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall take the cream and the muffings,\" added Amy, heroically giving\n",
      "up the article she most liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\n",
      "big plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\n",
      "shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\n",
      "milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were soon ready, and the procession set out.  Fortunately it was\n",
      "early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\n",
      "no one laughed at the queer party.\n",
      "\n",
      "A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\n",
      "ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\n",
      "hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\n",
      "crying for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them to laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\n",
      "there.  Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\n",
      "broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.  Mrs. March gave the\n",
      "mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while\n",
      "she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.  The\n",
      "girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\n",
      "fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to\n",
      "understand the funny broken English.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Das ist gut!\"  \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things as they ate\n",
      "and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had\n",
      "never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,\n",
      "especially Jo, who had been considered a 'Sancho' ever since she was\n",
      "born.  That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of\n",
      "it.  And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there\n",
      "were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little\n",
      "girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with\n",
      "bread and milk on Christmas morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\n",
      "Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs\n",
      "collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\n",
      "the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white\n",
      "chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\n",
      "quite an elegant air to the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's coming!  Strike up, Beth!  Open the door, Amy!  Three cheers for\n",
      "Marmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to\n",
      "the seat of honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\n",
      "escort with great dignity.  Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,\n",
      "and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the\n",
      "little notes which accompanied them.  The slippers went on at once, a\n",
      "new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\n",
      "cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\n",
      "pronounced a perfect fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\n",
      "simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at\n",
      "the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\n",
      "the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.  Being\n",
      "still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to\n",
      "afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\n",
      "wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made\n",
      "whatever they needed.  Very clever were some of their productions,\n",
      "pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats\n",
      "covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering\n",
      "with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the\n",
      "same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of\n",
      "preserve pots were cut out.  The big chamber was the scene of many\n",
      "innocent revels.\n",
      "\n",
      "No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart's\n",
      "content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots\n",
      "given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.  These boots,\n",
      "an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\n",
      "picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions.  The\n",
      "smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\n",
      "to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit\n",
      "for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\n",
      "whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage\n",
      "besides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless\n",
      "amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been\n",
      "idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the\n",
      "dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\n",
      "most flattering state of expectancy.  There was a good deal of rustling\n",
      "and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an\n",
      "occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\n",
      "excitement of the moment.  Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\n",
      "apart, and the operatic tragedy began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one playbill, was represented by a\n",
      "few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\n",
      "distance.  This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus\n",
      "for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black\n",
      "pot on it and an old witch bending over it.  The stage was dark and the\n",
      "glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\n",
      "from the kettle when the witch took off the cover.  A moment was\n",
      "allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,\n",
      "stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black\n",
      "beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots.  After pacing to and fro in\n",
      "much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,\n",
      "singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing\n",
      "resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's\n",
      "voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were\n",
      "very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for\n",
      "breath.  Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he\n",
      "stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,\n",
      "\"What ho, minion! I need thee!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and\n",
      "black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.  Hugo\n",
      "demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.\n",
      "Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call\n",
      "up the spirit who would bring the love philter.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Hither, hither, from thy home,\n",
      "    Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\n",
      "    Born of roses, fed on dew,\n",
      "    Charms and potions canst thou brew?\n",
      "    Bring me here, with elfin speed,\n",
      "    The fragrant philter which I need.\n",
      "    Make it sweet and swift and strong,\n",
      "    Spirit, answer now my song!\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\n",
      "appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\n",
      "hair, and a garland of roses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Hither I come,\n",
      "    From my airy home,\n",
      "    Afar in the silver moon.\n",
      "    Take the magic spell,\n",
      "    And use it well,\n",
      "    Or its power will vanish soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\n",
      "vanished.  Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a\n",
      "lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having\n",
      "croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a\n",
      "mocking laugh.  Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\n",
      "boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had\n",
      "killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and\n",
      "intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.  Then the curtain\n",
      "fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the\n",
      "merits of the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but\n",
      "when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been\n",
      "got up, no one murmured at the delay.  It was truly superb. A tower\n",
      "rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning\n",
      "in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and\n",
      "silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.  He came in gorgeous array, with\n",
      "plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of\n",
      "course.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in\n",
      "melting tones.  Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented\n",
      "to fly.  Then came the grand effect of the play.  Roderigo produced a\n",
      "rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara\n",
      "to descend.  Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on\n",
      "Roderigo's shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when \"Alas!\n",
      "Alas for Zara!\" she forgot her train.  It caught in the window, the\n",
      "tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the\n",
      "unhappy lovers in the ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\n",
      "wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so!  I told\n",
      "you so!\"  With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,\n",
      "rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't laugh!  Act as if it was all right!\" and, ordering Roderigo up,\n",
      "banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\n",
      "shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\n",
      "gentleman and refused to stir.  This dauntless example fired Zara.  She\n",
      "also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\n",
      "of the castle.  A stout little retainer came in with chains and led\n",
      "them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the\n",
      "speech he ought to have made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to\n",
      "free the lovers and finish Hugo.  She hears him coming and hides, sees\n",
      "him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little\n",
      "servant, \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I\n",
      "shall come anon.\"  The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something,\n",
      "and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.\n",
      "Ferdinando, the 'minion', carries them away, and Hagar puts back the\n",
      "cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty\n",
      "after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal\n",
      "of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him\n",
      "what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have\n",
      "thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair\n",
      "rather marred the effect of the villain's death.  He was called before\n",
      "the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose\n",
      "singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the\n",
      "performance put together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\n",
      "himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\n",
      "the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\n",
      "informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if\n",
      "he will.  A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\n",
      "rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his\n",
      "lady love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\n",
      "wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and after a\n",
      "touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands\n",
      "her hand.  Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\n",
      "gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear\n",
      "away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter\n",
      "and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.  The latter\n",
      "informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair\n",
      "and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy.  The bag\n",
      "is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage\n",
      "till it is quite glorified with the glitter.  This entirely softens the\n",
      "stern sire.  He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,\n",
      "and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's\n",
      "blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the\n",
      "cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and\n",
      "extinguished the enthusiastic audience.  Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\n",
      "the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\n",
      "with laughter.  The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah\n",
      "appeared, with \"Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk\n",
      "down to supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,\n",
      "they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.  It was like Marmee\n",
      "to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was\n",
      "unheard of since the departed days of plenty.  There was ice cream,\n",
      "actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and\n",
      "distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great\n",
      "bouquets of hot house flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and\n",
      "then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Santa Claus,\" said Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother did it.\" And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray\n",
      "beard and white eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a\n",
      "sudden inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All wrong.  Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing\n",
      "into his head?  We don't know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\n",
      "odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.  He knew my father years ago,\n",
      "and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\n",
      "allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\n",
      "them a few trifles in honor of the day.  I could not refuse, and so you\n",
      "have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\n",
      "breakfast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did!  He's a capital fellow,\n",
      "and I wish we could get acquainted.  He looks as if he'd like to know\n",
      "us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him\n",
      "when we pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to\n",
      "melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?\"\n",
      "asked one of the girls.  \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says\n",
      "he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps\n",
      "his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor,\n",
      "and makes him study very hard.  We invited him to our party, but he\n",
      "didn't come.  Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us\n",
      "girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\n",
      "fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on,\n",
      "when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.  I mean to know him some day,\n",
      "for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I've no\n",
      "objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He\n",
      "brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had\n",
      "been sure what was going on upstairs.  He looked so wistful as he went\n",
      "away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a mercy you didn't, Mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\n",
      "\"But we'll have another play sometime that he can see.  Perhaps he'll\n",
      "help act.  Wouldn't that be jolly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never had such a fine bouquet before!  How pretty it is!\" And Meg\n",
      "examined her flowers with great interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are lovely.  But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my\n",
      "bunch to Father.  I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as\n",
      "we are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo!  Jo!  Where are you?\" cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found\n",
      "her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped\n",
      "up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window.\n",
      "This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a\n",
      "dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a\n",
      "pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle.  As Meg\n",
      "appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole.  Jo shook the tears off her\n",
      "cheeks and waited to hear the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such fun!  Only see!  A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner\n",
      "for tomorrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then\n",
      "proceeding to read it with girlish delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at\n",
      "a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go, now\n",
      "what shall we wear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our\n",
      "poplins, because we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo with her\n",
      "mouth full.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg.  \"Mother says I may when I'm\n",
      "eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\n",
      "Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\n",
      "Whatever shall I do?  The burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The\n",
      "front is all right.  I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\n",
      "will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\n",
      "my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I\n",
      "shall have to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much\n",
      "about dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must have gloves, or I won't go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves are\n",
      "more important than anything else.  You can't dance without them, and\n",
      "if you don't I should be so mortified.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll stay still.  I don't care much for company dancing. It's no\n",
      "fun to go sailing round.  I like to fly about and cut capers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\n",
      "so careless.  She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn't\n",
      "get you any more this winter.  Can't you make them do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how\n",
      "stained they are.  That's all I can do.  No!  I'll tell you how we can\n",
      "manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.  Don't you see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\n",
      "dreadfully,\" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll go without.  I don't care what people say!\" cried Jo, taking\n",
      "up her book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may have it, you may!  Only don't stain it, and do behave nicely.\n",
      "Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher\n",
      "Columbus!' will you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't worry about me.  I'll be as prim as I can and not get into any\n",
      "scrapes, if I can help it.  Now go and answer your note, and let me\n",
      "finish this splendid story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Meg went away to 'accept with thanks', look over her dress, and sing\n",
      "blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her\n",
      "story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\n",
      "\n",
      "On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls\n",
      "played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the\n",
      "all-important business of 'getting ready for the party'.  Simple as the\n",
      "toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing\n",
      "and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the\n",
      "house.  Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to\n",
      "pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth from her perch on the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a queer smell!  It's like burned feathers,\" observed Amy,\n",
      "smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\n",
      "ringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\n",
      "hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of\n",
      "little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?  I'm spoiled!  I can't go!  My hair,\n",
      "oh, my hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on\n",
      "her forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just my luck!  You shouldn't have asked me to do it.  I always spoil\n",
      "everything.  I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made\n",
      "a mess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with\n",
      "tears of regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't spoiled.  Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends\n",
      "come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion.\n",
      "I've seen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Serves me right for trying to be fine.  I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\n",
      "cried Meg petulantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.  But it will soon grow out\n",
      "again,\" said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\n",
      "\n",
      "After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\n",
      "united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her\n",
      "dress on.  They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in\n",
      "silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin.\n",
      "Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white\n",
      "chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light\n",
      "glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite\n",
      "easy and fine\".  Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt\n",
      "her, though she would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed\n",
      "stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but,\n",
      "dear me, let us be elegant or die.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\n",
      "daintily down the walk.  \"Don't eat much supper, and come away at\n",
      "eleven when I send Hannah for you.\"  As the gate clashed behind them, a\n",
      "voice cried from a window...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls, girls!  Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding\n",
      "with a laugh as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\n",
      "were all running away from an earthquake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real\n",
      "lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied\n",
      "Meg, who had a good many little 'aristocratic tastes' of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\n",
      "right?  And does my hair look very bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from\n",
      "the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I shall forget.  If you see me doing anything wrong, just\n",
      "remind me by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch\n",
      "and her head a hasty brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, winking isn't ladylike.  I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is\n",
      "wrong, and nod if you are all right.  Now hold your shoulder straight,\n",
      "and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to\n",
      "anyone.  It isn't the thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you learn all the proper ways?  I never can.  Isn't that music\n",
      "gay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to\n",
      "parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to\n",
      "them.  Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and\n",
      "handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie\n",
      "and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls\n",
      "or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the\n",
      "wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden.  Half\n",
      "a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the\n",
      "room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the\n",
      "joys of her life.  She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows\n",
      "went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir.  No one came to talk to\n",
      "her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.\n",
      "She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth\n",
      "would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing\n",
      "began.  Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so\n",
      "briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered\n",
      "smilingly.  Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and\n",
      "fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess,\n",
      "intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace.  Unfortunately, another\n",
      "bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell\n",
      "behind her, she found herself face to face with the 'Laurence boy'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\n",
      "back out as speedily as she had bounced in.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\n",
      "startled, \"Don't mind me, stay if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shan't I disturb you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit.  I only came here because I don't know many people and felt\n",
      "rather strange at first, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So did I.  Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\n",
      "be polite and easy, \"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you\n",
      "before.  You live near us, don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Next door.\"  And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim\n",
      "manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about\n",
      "cricket when he brought the cat home.\n",
      "\n",
      "That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her\n",
      "heartiest way, \"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas\n",
      "present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandpa sent it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober\n",
      "while his black eyes shone with fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.  But I am not Miss March, I'm only\n",
      "Jo,\" returned the young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\n",
      "me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate my name, too, so sentimental!  I wish every one would say Jo\n",
      "instead of Josephine.  How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thrashed 'em.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.\"  And\n",
      "Jo resigned herself with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\n",
      "thought the name suited her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is\n",
      "lively.  In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on\n",
      "people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and\n",
      "let Meg sail about.  Don't you dance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes.  You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't\n",
      "been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Abroad!\" cried Jo.  \"Oh, tell me about it!  I love dearly to hear\n",
      "people describe their travels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions\n",
      "soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay,\n",
      "where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,\n",
      "and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their\n",
      "teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo.  \"Did you go to Paris?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We spent last winter there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you talk French?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do say some!  I can read it, but can't pronounce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nicely you do it!  Let me see ... you said, 'Who is the young lady\n",
      "in the pretty slippers', didn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oui, mademoiselle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!  Do you think she is\n",
      "pretty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\n",
      "quiet, and dances like a lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\n",
      "stored it up to repeat to Meg.  Both peeped and criticized and chatted\n",
      "till they felt like old acquaintances.  Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\n",
      "off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\n",
      "Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody\n",
      "lifted their eyebrows at her.  She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than\n",
      "ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\n",
      "to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\n",
      "were almost unknown creatures to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine\n",
      "teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy,\n",
      "and altogether jolly.  Wonder how old he is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself in\n",
      "time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you are going to college soon?  I see you pegging away at\n",
      "your books, no, I mean studying hard.\"  And Jo blushed at the dreadful\n",
      "'pegging' which had escaped her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.  \"Not\n",
      "for a year or two.  I won't go before seventeen, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\n",
      "had imagined seventeen already.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sixteen, next month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How I wish I was going to college!  You don't look as if you liked it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate it!  Nothing but grinding or skylarking.  And I don't like the\n",
      "way fellows do either, in this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows\n",
      "looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject\n",
      "by saying, as her foot kept time, \"That's a splendid polka!  Why don't\n",
      "you go and try it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, because...\" There Jo stopped, and\n",
      "looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because, what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't tell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\n",
      "frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it\n",
      "shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it.  You may\n",
      "laugh, if you want to.  It is funny, I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Laurie didn't laugh.  He only looked down a minute, and the\n",
      "expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, \"Never mind\n",
      "that.  I'll tell you how we can manage.  There's a long hall out there,\n",
      "and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when\n",
      "she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.  The hall was\n",
      "empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught\n",
      "her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and\n",
      "spring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get\n",
      "their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students'\n",
      "festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister.  She\n",
      "beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she\n",
      "found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've sprained my ankle.  That stupid high heel turned and gave me a\n",
      "sad wrench.  It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm\n",
      "ever going to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes.  I'm sorry.  But I\n",
      "don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\n",
      "night,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much.  I dare say\n",
      "I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a\n",
      "long way to the stable, and no one to send.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!  It's past nine, and dark as Egypt.  I can't stop here,\n",
      "for the house is full.  Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll\n",
      "rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll ask Laurie.  He will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\n",
      "occurred to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy, no!  Don't ask or tell anyone.  Get me my rubbers, and put\n",
      "these slippers with our things.  I can't dance anymore, but as soon as\n",
      "supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are going out to supper now.  I'll stay with you.  I'd rather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.  I'm so tired I can't\n",
      "stir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\n",
      "to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet,\n",
      "and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a\n",
      "little private refreshment.  Making a dart at the table, she secured\n",
      "the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of\n",
      "her dress as bad as the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's\n",
      "glove by scrubbing her gown with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice.  And there was Laurie, with a\n",
      "full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone\n",
      "shook me, and here I am in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing\n",
      "dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bad!   I was looking for someone to give this to.  May I take it\n",
      "to your sister?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you!  I'll show you where she is.  I don't offer to take it\n",
      "myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\n",
      "little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,\n",
      "and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a 'nice\n",
      "boy'.  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in\n",
      "the midst of a quiet game of Buzz, with two or three other young\n",
      "people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.  Meg forgot her foot\n",
      "and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an\n",
      "exclamation of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush!  Don't say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It's\n",
      "nothing.  I turned my foot a little, that's all,\" and limped upstairs\n",

      "Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\n",
      "decided to take things into her own hands.  Slipping out, she ran down\n",
      "and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\n",
      "happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood\n",
      "and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she\n",

      "\n",
      "That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\n",

      "hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they\n",
      "rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\n",
      "elegant.  Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\n",
      "girls talked over their party in freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a capital time.  Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\n",
      "making herself comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, till I hurt myself.  Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy\n",
      "to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does.\n",
      "She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be\n",
      "perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering\n",

      "\"I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.  Was he\n",
      "nice?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"No, but it was very rude.  What were you about all that time, hidden\n",
      "away there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at\n",

      "\n",
      "With what Meg called 'a great want of manners' Jo had saved some\n",

      "most thrilling events of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\n",
      "from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to\n",
      "wait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed\n",
      "her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\n",
      "do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight\n",
      "slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"\n",
      "And I think Jo was quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\"\n",
      "sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over,\n",
      "the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it be\n",
      "fun?\" answered Jo, yawning dismally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does\n",
      "seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties,\n",
      "and drive home, and read and rest, and not work.  It's like other\n",
      "people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I'm so\n",
      "fond of luxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns\n",
      "was the least shabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder our\n",

      "March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\n",
      "learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get\n",
      "so light that I shan't mind her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg\n",
      "didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children,\n",
      "seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself\n",
      "pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair\n",
      "in the most becoming way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\n",
      "midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?\" she muttered,\n",
      "shutting her drawer with a jerk.  \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\n",
      "days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\n",

      "croak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with\n",
      "the cat and three kittens.  Amy was fretting because her lessons were\n",
      "not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers.  Jo would whistle and\n",
      "make a great racket getting ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at\n",
      "once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't suit her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There never was such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper when\n",

      "her hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them\n",

      "which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute!  I must get this off by the\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\n",
      "hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were\n",
      "an institution, and the girls called them 'muffs', for they had no\n",

      "pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\n",
      "always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\n",
      "Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\n",
      "that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\n",

      "bitter wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't use such dreadful expressions,\" replied Meg from the depths of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I like good strong words that mean something,\" replied Jo, catching\n",

      "envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl\n",

      "\"I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I'll\n",

      "Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like\n",
      "fury till she wakes up.  I actually made myself sleepy, and before she\n",
      "began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\n",
      "opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could, and be done with it,\" said I, trying not to be saucy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\n",
      "think them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\n",
      "finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a\n",
      "top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield out of my pocket,\n",
      "and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I'd just got to\n",
      "where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out\n",
      "loud.  Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\n",
      "to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\n",
      "and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\n",
      "she only said...\n",

      "\"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave\n",

      "after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar\n",
      "that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of\n",
      "the good time coming.  What a pleasant life she might have if only she\n",
      "chose!  I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all\n",

      "\"That reminds me,\" said Meg, \"that I've got something to tell. It isn't\n",
      "funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came\n",
      "home.  At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of\n",
      "the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful,\n",
      "and Papa had sent him away.  I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King\n",
      "talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when\n",
      "they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and swollen their eyes were.\n",
      "I didn't ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and\n",

      "today with a lovely red carnelian ring.  I wanted it dreadfully, and\n",
      "wished I was her with all my might.  Well, she drew a picture of Mr.\n",
      "Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies,\n",
      "my eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing.  We\n",
      "were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us, and he\n",

      "but she went, and oh, what do you think he did?  He took her by the\n",
      "ear—the ear!  Just fancy how horrid!—and led her to the recitation\n",

      "everyone could see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?\" asked Jo, who relished the\n",
      "scrape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know\n",
      "she did.  I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian\n",
      "rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should\n",
      "have got over such a agonizing mortification.\" And Amy went on with her\n",
      "work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance\n",
      "of two long words in a breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at\n",
      "dinner, but I forgot,\" said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in\n",
      "order as she talked.  \"When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.\n",
      "Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, for I kept behind\n",
      "the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor\n",
      "woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would\n",
      "let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any\n",
      "dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day's work.\n",
      "Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said 'No', rather crossly, so she was\n",
      "going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big\n",
      "fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her.  She was\n",
      "so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him\n",
      "over and over.  He told her to 'go along and cook it', and she hurried\n",
      "off, so happy!  Wasn't it good of him?  Oh, she did look so funny,\n",
      "hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven\n",
      "would be 'aisy'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one,\n",
      "and after a moments thought, she said soberly, \"As I sat cutting out\n",

      "Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything\n",
      "happened to him.  It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying\n",
      "till an old man came in with an order for some clothes.  He sat down\n",
      "near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and\n",
      "anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought was not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give\n",
      "his all, that I was ashamed of myself.  I'd given one man and thought\n",
      "it too much, while he gave four without grudging them.  I had all my\n",
      "girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away,\n",
      "to say good-by to him, perhaps!  I felt so rich, so happy thinking of\n",
      "my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\n",

      "said Jo, after a minute's silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this\n",
      "little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and\n",

      "parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\" (Here\n",
      "the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew\n",
      "diligently.) \"These girls were anxious to be good and made many\n",
      "excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were\n",
      "constantly saying, 'If only we had this,' or 'If we could only do\n",
      "that,' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things\n",
      "they actually could do.  So they asked an old woman what spell they\n",
      "could use to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feel\n",
      "discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'\" (Here Jo\n",
      "looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing\n",
      "that the story was not done yet.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were\n",
      "surprised to see how well off they were.  One discovered that money\n",
      "couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses, another\n",
      "that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her\n",
      "youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old\n",
      "lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it\n",
      "was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and\n",
      "the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good\n",
      "behavior.  So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings\n",
      "already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken\n",
      "away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never\n",
      "disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's advice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories\n",
      "against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\" cried Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like that kind of sermon.  It's the sort Father used to tell us,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more\n",
      "careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it.  If we do so, you just\n",

      "chillen!' 'Tink ob yer marcies!'\" added Jo, who could not, for the life\n",
      "of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though\n",
      "she took it to heart as much as any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\" asked Meg one snowy\n",
      "afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber\n",
      "boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going out for exercise,\" answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!\n",
      "It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the\n",
      "fire, as I do,\" said Meg with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never take advice!  Can't keep still all day, and not being a\n",
      "pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire.  I like adventures, and I'm\n",
      "going to find some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe, and Jo began to dig\n",
      "paths with great energy.  The snow was light, and with her broom she\n",
      "soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the\n",
      "sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air.  Now, the garden\n",
      "separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence.  Both stood in\n",
      "a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and\n",
      "lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets.  A low hedge parted the two\n",
      "estates.  On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and\n",
      "shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the\n",
      "flowers, which then surrounded it.  On the other side was a stately\n",
      "stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,\n",
      "from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and\n",
      "the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children\n",
      "frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and\n",
      "few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted\n",
      "palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.  She had\n",
      "long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence\n",
      "boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to\n",
      "begin.  Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had\n",
      "planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen\n",
      "lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied\n",
      "a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their\n",
      "garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That boy is suffering for society and fun,\" she said to herself. \"His\n",
      "grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all\n",
      "alone.  He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\n",
      "and lively.  I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman\n",
      "so!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always\n",
      "scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.  The plan of 'going over'\n",
      "was not forgotten.  And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to\n",
      "try what could be done.  She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then\n",
      "sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took\n",
      "a survey.  All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out\n",
      "of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a\n",
      "thin hand at the upper window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"Poor boy!  All alone and sick this dismal\n",
      "day.  It's a shame!  I'll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and\n",
      "then say a kind word to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\n",
      "face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\n",
      "brightened and the mouth began to smile.  Jo nodded and laughed, and\n",
      "flourished her broom as she called out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you do?  Are you sick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better, thank you.  I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry.  What do you amuse yourself with?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing.  It's dull as tombs up here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you read?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much.  They won't let me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't somebody read to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and I hate to\n",
      "ask Brooke all the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have someone come and see you then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There isn't anyone I'd like to see.  Boys make such a row, and my head\n",
      "is weak.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?  Girls are quiet\n",
      "and like to play nurse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know any.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I do!  Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go\n",
      "ask her.  Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,\n",
      "wondering what they would all say to her.  Laurie was in a flutter of\n",
      "excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,\n",
      "for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to\n",
      "the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color,\n",
      "and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen\n",
      "servants, was anything but neat.  Presently there came a loud ring,\n",
      "than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking\n",
      "servant came running up to announce a young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,\" said Laurie, going to the door\n",
      "of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite\n",
      "at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens\n",
      "in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here I am, bag and baggage,\" she said briskly.  \"Mother sent her love,\n",
      "and was glad if I could do anything for you.  Meg wanted me to bring\n",
      "some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her\n",
      "cats would be comforting.  I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't\n",
      "refuse, she was so anxious to do something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in\n",
      "laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew\n",
      "sociable at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\n",
      "uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland\n",
      "of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.\n",
      "Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.  It's so simple you can eat\n",
      "it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\n",
      "What a cozy room this is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't\n",
      "know how to make them mind.  It worries me though.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth\n",
      "brushed, so—and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so—and\n",
      "the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from\n",
      "the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.  Now then, you're fixed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\n",
      "into place and given quite a different air to the room.  Laurie watched\n",
      "her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he\n",
      "sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you are!  Yes, that's what it wanted.  Now please take the\n",
      "big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I came to amuse you.  Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked\n",
      "affectionately toward some inviting books near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you!  I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather\n",
      "talk,\" answered Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit.  I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I\n",
      "never know when to stop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes\n",
      "out with a little basket?\" asked Laurie with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's Beth.  She's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you find that out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see I often hear you\n",
      "calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help\n",
      "looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good\n",
      "times.  I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget\n",
      "to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when\n",
      "the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire,\n",
      "and you all around the table with your mother.  Her face is right\n",
      "opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help\n",
      "watching it.  I haven't got any mother, you know.\" And Laurie poked the\n",
      "fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.\n",
      "She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\n",
      "and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child.  Laurie was\n",
      "sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness,\n",
      "she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and\n",
      "her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look\n",
      "as much as you like.  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd\n",
      "come over and see us.  Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of\n",
      "good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would\n",
      "dance.  Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,\n",
      "and we'd have jolly times.  Wouldn't your grandpa let you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he would, if your mother asked him.  He's very kind, though he\n",
      "does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's\n",
      "afraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening\n",
      "more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be\n",
      "a bother.  We want to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever\n",
      "so long.  We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got\n",
      "acquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what\n",
      "happens outside.  Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know,\n",
      "and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get\n",
      "on as I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's bad.  You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere\n",
      "you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places\n",
      "to go to.  Never mind being bashful.  It won't last long if you keep\n",
      "going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of\n",
      "bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible\n",
      "not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\n",
      "little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about\n",
      "her, well pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't go to school, I'm a businessman—girl, I mean.  I go to wait on\n",
      "my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just\n",
      "in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's\n",
      "affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt\n",
      "March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady,\n",
      "her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where\n",
      "she reveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old\n",
      "gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine\n",
      "speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy\n",
      "lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid\n",
      "popped her head in to see what was the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  That does me no end of good.  Tell on, please,\" he said, taking\n",
      "his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much elated with her success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their plays\n",
      "and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting\n",
      "events of the little world in which the sisters lived.  Then they got\n",
      "to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie\n",
      "loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours.  Grandfather is out,\n",
      "so you needn't be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\n",
      "admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to\n",
      "be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\n",
      "moods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way\n",
      "from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her\n",
      "fancy.  And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her\n",
      "hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.  It was\n",
      "lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting\n",
      "little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow\n",
      "chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open\n",
      "fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair\n",
      "and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore\n",
      "Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\n",
      "impressively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fellow can't live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head as he\n",
      "perched on a table opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\n",
      "alarm, \"Mercy me!  It's your grandpa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what if it is?  You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\n",
      "returned the boy, looking wicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should\n",
      "be.  Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse\n",
      "for it,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only\n",
      "afraid you are very tired of talking to me.  It was so pleasant, I\n",
      "couldn't bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute?  I suppose I must see him,\"\n",
      "said Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't mind me.  I'm happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\n",
      "standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door\n",
      "opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, \"I'm sure now\n",
      "that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his\n",
      "mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\n",
      "He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her\n",
      "great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\n",
      "to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.  For a\n",
      "minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,\n",
      "and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out\n",
      "of the scrape as she could.  A second look showed her that the living\n",
      "eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,\n",
      "and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good\n",
      "deal.  The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said\n",
      "abruptly, after the dreadful pause, \"So you're not afraid of me, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only said I thought so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you like me in spite of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That answer pleased the old gentleman.  He gave a short laugh, shook\n",
      "hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\n",
      "face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, \"You've\n",
      "got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face.  He was a fine\n",
      "man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\n",
      "I was proud to be his friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it\n",
      "suited her exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next\n",
      "question, sharply put.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir.\"  And Jo told how her visit came\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\n",
      "perhaps.  We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\n",
      "for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said\n",
      "Jo eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tut, tut, tut!  That was the boy's affair.  How is the poor woman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doing nicely, sir.\"  And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told\n",
      "all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends\n",
      "than they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just her father's way of doing good.  I shall come and see your mother\n",
      "some fine day.  Tell her so.  There's the tea bell, we have it early on\n",
      "the boy's account.  Come down and go on being neighborly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'd like to have me, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.\"  And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm\n",
      "with old-fashioned courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would Meg say to this?\" thought Jo, as she was marched away,\n",
      "while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the\n",
      "story at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hey!  Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old\n",
      "gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a\n",
      "start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his\n",
      "redoubtable grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you'd come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\n",
      "little glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs.  Come to your tea,\n",
      "sir, and behave like a gentleman.\"  And having pulled the boy's hair by\n",
      "way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\n",
      "series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\n",
      "explosion of laughter from Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,\n",
      "but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old\n",
      "friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.  There was\n",
      "color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner,\n",
      "and genuine merriment in his laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's right, the lad is lonely.  I'll see what these little girls can\n",
      "do for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened.  He liked\n",
      "Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand\n",
      "the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she would not\n",
      "have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward.\n",
      "But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\n",
      "impression.  When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\n",
      "something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory,\n",
      "which had been lighted for her benefit.  It seemed quite fairylike to\n",
      "Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on\n",
      "either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful\n",
      "vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the\n",
      "finest flowers till his hands were full.  Then he tied them up, saying,\n",
      "with the happy look Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother,\n",
      "and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing\n",
      "room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which\n",
      "stood open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\n",
      "expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please do now.  I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you first?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know how.  Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\n",
      "heliotrope and tea roses.  Her respect and regard for the 'Laurence'\n",
      "boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put\n",
      "on any airs.  She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so,\n",
      "only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to\n",
      "his rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do, that will do, young lady.  Too many sugarplums are not\n",
      "good for him.  His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in\n",
      "more important things.  Going?  well, I'm much obliged to you, and I\n",
      "hope you'll come again.  My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor\n",
      "Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.\n",
      "When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something\n",
      "amiss.  He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it was me.  He doesn't like to hear me play.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No need of that.  I am not a young lady, and it's only a step.  Take\n",
      "care of yourself, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you promise to come and see us after you are well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, Laurie!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, Jo, good night!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt\n",
      "inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very\n",
      "attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March\n",
      "wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten\n",
      "him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand\n",
      "piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,\n",
      "who was of an inquiring disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,\n",
      "married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\n",
      "is very proud.  The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he\n",
      "did not like her, and never saw his son after he married.  They both\n",
      "died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him\n",
      "home.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and\n",
      "the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.\n",
      "Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother,\n",
      "and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.\n",
      "At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so\n",
      "he 'glowered' as Jo said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How silly!\" said Jo.  \"Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not\n",
      "plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\n",
      "suppose.  Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little\n",
      "sentimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you know about his eyes and his manners?  You never spoke to\n",
      "him, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was not sentimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to\n",
      "behave.  That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How stupid you are, child!  He meant you, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he?\" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never saw such a girl!  You don't know a compliment when you get\n",
      "it,\" said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the\n",
      "matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly\n",
      "and spoil my fun.  Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I won't have\n",
      "any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish.  We'll all be\n",
      "good to him because he hasn't got any mother, and he may come over and\n",
      "see us, mayn't he, Marmee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will\n",
      "remember that children should be children as long as they can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,\" observed\n",
      "Amy.  \"What do you say, Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was thinking about our 'Pilgrim's Progress',\" answered Beth, who\n",
      "had not heard a word.  \"How we got out of the Slough and through the\n",
      "Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying,\n",
      "and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going\n",
      "to be our Palace Beautiful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have got to get by the lions first,\" said Jo, as if she rather\n",
      "liked the prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time\n",
      "for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions.  Old\n",
      "Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said\n",
      "something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old\n",
      "times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid\n",
      "Beth.  The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,\n",
      "for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.\n",
      "But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors,\n",
      "and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\n",
      "motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\n",
      "that humble home of theirs.  So they soon forgot their pride and\n",
      "interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new\n",
      "friendship flourished like grass in spring.  Every one liked Laurie,\n",
      "and he privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\n",
      "splendid girls.\"  With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took\n",
      "the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found\n",
      "something very charming in the innocent companionship of these\n",
      "simple-hearted girls.  Never having known mother or sisters, he was\n",
      "quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy,\n",
      "lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired\n",
      "of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was\n",
      "obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always\n",
      "playing truant and running over to the Marches'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,\" said\n",
      "the old gentleman.  \"The good lady next door says he is studying too\n",
      "hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.  I suspect she\n",
      "is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his\n",
      "grandmother.  Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He\n",
      "can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.\n",
      "March is doing more for him than we can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What good times they had, to be sure.  Such plays and tableaux, such\n",
      "sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\n",
      "parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.\n",
      "Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in\n",
      "bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed\n",
      "the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed\n",
      "beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played 'lord of the manor' in\n",
      "the most delightful style.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\n",
      "courage to go to the 'Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it.  She went\n",
      "once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,\n",
      "stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\" so\n",
      "loud, that he frightened her so much her 'feet chattered on the floor',\n",
      "she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never\n",
      "go there any more, not even for the dear piano.  No persuasions or\n",
      "enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.\n",
      "Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.\n",
      "During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation\n",
      "to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine\n",
      "organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found\n",
      "it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and\n",
      "nearer, as if fascinated.  At the back of his chair she stopped and\n",
      "stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with\n",
      "excitement of this unusual performance.  Taking no more notice of her\n",
      "than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's\n",
      "lessons and teachers.  And presently, as if the idea had just occurred\n",
      "to him, he said to Mrs. March...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting\n",
      "too fond of it.  But the piano suffers for want of use.  Wouldn't some\n",
      "of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just\n",
      "to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to\n",
      "keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and\n",
      "the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her\n",
      "breath away.  Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with\n",
      "an odd little nod and smile...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm\n",
      "shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a\n",
      "great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine\n",
      "o'clock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\n",
      "last arrangement left nothing to be desired.  \"Please, tell the young\n",
      "ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.\"\n",
      "Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\n",
      "face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh sir, they do care, very very much!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as\n",
      "he looked down at her very kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm Beth.  I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure\n",
      "nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude,\n",
      "and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a soul, my dear.  The house is empty half the day, so come and\n",
      "drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you are, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was\n",
      "not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she\n",
      "had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The\n",
      "old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping\n",
      "down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.  God bless you, my\n",
      "dear!  Good day, madam.\"  And away he went, in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the\n",
      "glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home.\n",
      "How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her\n",
      "because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\n",
      "her sleep.  Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out\n",
      "of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\n",
      "side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing\n",
      "room where her idol stood.  Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,\n",
      "easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent\n",
      "stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\n",
      "instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\n",
      "else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\n",
      "like the voice of a beloved friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no\n",
      "appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state\n",
      "of beatitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly\n",
      "every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit\n",
      "that came and went unseen.  She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his\n",
      "study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.  She never saw\n",
      "Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never\n",
      "suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the\n",
      "rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her\n",
      "about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things\n",
      "that helped her so much.  So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found,\n",
      "what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had\n",
      "hoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing\n",
      "that a greater was given her.  At any rate she deserved both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.  He is so\n",
      "kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do\n",
      "it?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, dear.  It will please him very much, and be a nice way of\n",
      "thanking him.  The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for\n",
      "the making up,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in\n",
      "granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\n",
      "the materials bought, and the slippers begun.  A cluster of grave yet\n",
      "cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very\n",
      "appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with\n",
      "occasional lifts over hard parts.  She was a nimble little needlewoman,\n",
      "and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.  Then she wrote\n",
      "a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto\n",
      "the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.\n",
      "All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement\n",
      "arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety\n",
      "friend.  On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\n",
      "errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.  As\n",
      "she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads\n",
      "popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\n",
      "several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a letter from the old gentleman!  Come quick, and read it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Beth, he's sent you...\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly\n",
      "energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down\n",
      "the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.  At the door her sisters\n",
      "seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\n",
      "pointing and all saying at once, \"Look there!  Look there!\"  Beth did\n",
      "look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a\n",
      "little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed\n",
      "like a sign board to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me?\" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should\n",
      "tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, all for you, my precious!  Isn't it splendid of him?  Don't you\n",
      "think he's the dearest old man in the world?  Here's the key in the\n",
      "letter.  We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\"\n",
      "cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You read it!  I can't, I feel so queer!  Oh, it is too lovely!\" and\n",
      "Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\n",
      "were...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss March: \"Dear Madam—\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice it sounds!  I wish someone would write to me so!\" said Amy,\n",
      "who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any\n",
      "that suited me so well as yours,'\" continues Jo.  \"'Heart's-ease is my\n",
      "favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver.\n",
      "I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow 'the old gentleman' to\n",
      "send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he\n",
      "lost.  With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain \"'Your grateful\n",
      "friend and humble servant, 'JAMES LAURENCE'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me\n",
      "how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept\n",
      "all her little things carefully.  Just think, he's given you her piano.\n",
      "That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying\n",
      "to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever\n",
      "been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\n",
      "puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\n",
      "stool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\n",
      "its beauties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Your humble servant, James Laurence'.  Only think of his writing that\n",
      "to you.  I'll tell the girls.  They'll think it's splendid,\" said Amy,\n",
      "much impressed by the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try it, honey.  Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,\" said Hannah,\n",
      "who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano\n",
      "ever heard.  It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie\n",
      "order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the\n",
      "happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly\n",
      "touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright\n",
      "pedals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have to go and thank him,\" said Jo, by way of a joke, for the\n",
      "idea of the child's really going never entered her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I mean to.  I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking\n",
      "about it.\" And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth\n",
      "walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the\n",
      "Laurences' door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see!  The\n",
      "pianny has turned her head!  She'd never have gone in her right mind,\"\n",
      "cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite\n",
      "speechless by the miracle.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did\n",
      "afterward.  If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study\n",
      "door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice\n",
      "called out, \"come in!\" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who\n",
      "looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a\n",
      "small quaver in her voice, \"I came to thank you, sir, for...\" But she\n",
      "didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech\n",
      "and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she\n",
      "put both arms round his neck and kissed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman\n",
      "wouldn't have been more astonished.  But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he\n",
      "liked it amazingly!  And was so touched and pleased by that confiding\n",
      "little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on\n",
      "his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as\n",
      "if he had got his own little granddaughter back again.  Beth ceased to\n",
      "fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if\n",
      "she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude\n",
      "can conquer pride.  When she went home, he walked with her to her own\n",
      "gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back\n",
      "again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old\n",
      "gentleman, as he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of\n",
      "expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her\n",
      "surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, \"Well, I do believe\n",
      "the world is coming to an end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?\" said Amy one day, as Laurie\n",
      "clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes?  And very handsome\n",
      "ones they are, too,\" cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about\n",
      "her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need\n",
      "fire up when I admire his riding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my goodness!  That little goose means a centaur, and she called\n",
      "him a Cyclops,\" exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't be so rude, it's only a 'lapse of lingy', as Mr. Davis\n",
      "says,\" retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.  \"I just wish I had a\n",
      "little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\" she added, as if to\n",
      "herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's\n",
      "second blunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I need it so much.  I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to\n",
      "have the rag money for a month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In debt, Amy?  What do you mean?\" And Meg looked sober.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you\n",
      "know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged\n",
      "at the shop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me all about it.  Are limes the fashion now?  It used to be\n",
      "pricking bits of rubber to make balls.\"  And Meg tried to keep her\n",
      "countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to\n",
      "be thought mean, you must do it too.  It's nothing but limes now, for\n",
      "everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them\n",
      "off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess.\n",
      "If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime.  If she's mad with\n",
      "her, she eats one before her face, and doesn't offer even a suck.  They\n",
      "treat by turns, and I've had ever so many but haven't returned them,\n",
      "and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much will pay them off and restore your credit?\" asked Meg, taking\n",
      "out her purse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a\n",
      "treat for you.  Don't you like limes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much.  You may have my share.  Here's the money.  Make it last as\n",
      "long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you!  It must be so nice to have pocket money!  I'll have a\n",
      "grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week.  I felt delicate\n",
      "about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering\n",
      "for one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the\n",
      "temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper\n",
      "parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.\n",
      "During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got\n",
      "twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to\n",
      "treat circulated through her 'set', and the attentions of her friends\n",
      "became quite overwhelming.  Katy Brown invited her to her next party on\n",
      "the spot.  Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess,\n",
      "and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon\n",
      "her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish\n",
      "answers to certain appalling sums.  But Amy had not forgotten Miss\n",
      "Snow's cutting remarks about 'some persons whose noses were not too\n",
      "flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people who were not\n",
      "too proud to ask for them', and she instantly crushed 'that Snow\n",
      "girl's' hopes by the withering telegram, \"You needn't be so polite all\n",
      "of a sudden, for you won't get any.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning,\n",
      "and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her\n",
      "foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume\n",
      "the airs of a studious young peacock.  But, alas, alas!  Pride goes\n",
      "before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with\n",
      "disastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale\n",
      "compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking\n",
      "an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March\n",
      "had pickled limes in her desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\n",
      "vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\n",
      "law.  This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum\n",
      "after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated\n",
      "novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had\n",
      "forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done\n",
      "all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in\n",
      "order.  Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but\n",
      "girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with\n",
      "tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.\n",
      "Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of\n",
      "all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,\n",
      "feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular\n",
      "importance.  It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and\n",
      "Jenny knew it.  Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong\n",
      "that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his\n",

      "The word 'limes' was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and\n",
      "he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat\n",
      "with unusual rapidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young ladies, attention, if you please!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,\n",
      "gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss March, come to the desk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed\n",
      "her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,\" was the unexpected\n",
      "command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't take all.\" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great\n",
      "presence of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr.\n",
      "Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\n",
      "that delicious perfume met his nose.  Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\n",
      "particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\n",
      "added to his wrath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" stammered Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring the rest immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are sure there are no more?\"\n",

      "\"I never lie, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I see.  Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them\n",
      "out of the window.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as\n",
      "the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.\n",
      "Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times,\n",
      "and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from\n",
      "her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of\n",
      "the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by\n",
      "the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.  This—this was\n",
      "too much.  All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\n",
      "Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"\n",
      "and said, in his most impressive manner...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.  I am sorry\n",
      "this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I\n",
      "never break my word.  Miss March, hold out your hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\n",
      "look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.\n",
      "She was rather a favorite with 'old Davis', as, of course, he was\n",
      "called, and it's my private belief that he would have broken his word\n",
      "if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent\n",
      "in a hiss.  That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible\n",
      "gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your hand, Miss March!\" was the only answer her mute appeal received,\n",
      "and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head\n",
      "defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\n",
      "little palm.  They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\n",
      "difference to her.  For the first time in her life she had been struck,\n",
      "and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,\n",
      "resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was dreadful.  It would have been bad enough to go to her seat,\n",
      "and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her\n",
      "few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon\n",
      "her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only\n",
      "drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying.  A bitter\n",
      "sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it,\n",
      "and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove\n",
      "funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so\n",
      "motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that\n",
      "pathetic figure before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive\n",
      "little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.  To\n",
      "others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a\n",
      "hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been\n",
      "governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\n",
      "before.  The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\n",
      "in the sting of the thought, \"I shall have to tell at home, and they\n",
      "will be so disappointed in me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last,\n",
      "and the word 'Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\n",
      "uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she\n",
      "went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched\n",
      "her things, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared\n",
      "to herself.  She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the\n",
      "older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held\n",
      "at once.  Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and\n",
      "comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg\n",
      "bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even\n",
      "her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo\n",
      "wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and\n",
      "Hannah shook her fist at the 'villain' and pounded potatoes for dinner\n",
      "as if she had him under her pestle.\n",
      "\n",
      "No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but the\n",
      "sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\n",
      "the afternoon, also unusually nervous.  Just before school closed, Jo\n",
      "appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and\n",
      "delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy's property, and\n",
      "departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as\n",
      "if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\n",
      "little every day with Beth,\" said Mrs. March that evening. \"I don't\n",
      "approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.  I dislike Mr.\n",
      "Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls you associate with\n",
      "are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I\n",
      "send you anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's good!  I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\n",
      "school.  It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\"\n",
      "sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\n",
      "some punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\n",
      "disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"\n",
      "cried Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\n",
      "mother, \"but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a bolder\n",
      "method.  You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is\n",
      "quite time you set about correcting it.  You have a good many little\n",
      "gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit\n",
      "spoils the finest genius.  There is not much danger that real talent or\n",
      "goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of\n",
      "possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of\n",
      "all power is modesty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.\n",
      "\"I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and\n",
      "she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed\n",
      "when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if anyone had told\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I'd known that nice girl.  Maybe she would have helped me, I'm\n",
      "so stupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,\"\n",
      "answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\n",
      "merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\n",
      "in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\n",
      "could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\n",
      "Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly\n",
      "lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\n",
      "character.  When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening,\n",
      "said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, \"Is Laurie an\n",
      "accomplished boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will\n",
      "make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,\" replied her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he isn't conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least.  That is why he is so charming and we all like him\n",
      "so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see.  It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to\n",
      "show off or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and\n",
      "conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display\n",
      "them,\" said Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and\n",
      "ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,\" added Jo, and\n",
      "the lecture ended in a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls, where are you going?\" asked Amy, coming into their room one\n",
      "Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an\n",
      "air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind.  Little girls shouldn't ask questions,\" returned Jo\n",
      "sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young,\n",
      "it is to be told that, and to be bidden to \"run away, dear\" is still\n",
      "more trying to us.  Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to\n",
      "find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who\n",
      "never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me!\n",
      "I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her\n",
      "piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am so lonely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,\" began Meg, but Jo broke in\n",
      "impatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.  You can't\n",
      "go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.  You were\n",
      "whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you\n",
      "stopped when I came in.  Aren't you going with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we are.  Now do be still, and stop bothering.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her\n",
      "pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know!  I know!  You're going to the theater to see the Seven\n",
      "Castles!\" she cried, adding resolutely, \"and I shall go, for Mother\n",
      "said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and it was mean not to\n",
      "tell me in time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\" said Meg soothingly.\n",
      "\"Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not\n",
      "well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece.  Next week you\n",
      "can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please\n",
      "let me.  I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying\n",
      "for some fun.  Do, Meg!  I'll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as\n",
      "pathetic as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose we take her.  I don't believe Mother would mind, if we bundle\n",
      "her up well,\" began Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, and it\n",
      "will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy.  I\n",
      "should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted,\" said\n",
      "Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child\n",
      "when she wanted to enjoy herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,\n",
      "in her most aggravating way, \"I shall go.  Meg says I may, and if I pay\n",
      "for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit\n",
      "alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our\n",
      "pleasure.  Or he'll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper\n",
      "when you weren't asked.  You shan't stir a step, so you may just stay\n",
      "where you are,\" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her\n",
      "finger in her hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to\n",
      "reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls\n",
      "hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.  For now and then she\n",
      "forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child.  Just as the\n",
      "party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening\n",
      "tone, \"You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fiddlesticks!\" returned Jo, slamming the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a charming time, for The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake\n",
      "was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the\n",
      "comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and\n",
      "princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.  The fairy\n",
      "queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she\n",
      "amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her\n",
      "'sorry for it'.  She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the\n",
      "course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be\n",
      "violent when fairly roused.  Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\n",
      "semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\n",
      "afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\n",
      "hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually\n",
      "getting her into trouble.  Her anger never lasted long, and having\n",
      "humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do\n",
      "better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a\n",
      "fury because she was such an angel afterward.  Poor Jo tried\n",
      "desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame\n",
      "up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed\n",
      "an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or\n",
      "asked a single question.  Perhaps curiosity might have conquered\n",
      "resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing\n",
      "description of the play.  On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's\n",
      "first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had\n",
      "soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the\n",
      "floor.  Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance\n",
      "into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had\n",
      "forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced\n",
      "a tempest.  Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the\n",
      "afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding\n",
      "breathlessly, \"Has anyone taken my book?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg and Beth said, \"No.\" at once, and looked surprised.  Amy poked the\n",
      "fire and said nothing.  Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in\n",
      "a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amy, you've got it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I haven't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know where it is, then!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a fib!\" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking\n",
      "fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't.  I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't\n",
      "care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll\n",
      "make you.\"  And Jo gave her a slight shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book\n",
      "again,\" cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I burned it up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!  My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to\n",
      "finish before Father got home?  Have you really burned it?\" said Jo,\n",
      "turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy\n",
      "nervously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I did!  I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,\n",
      "and I have, so...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy\n",
      "till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and\n",
      "anger...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wicked, wicked girl!  I never can write it again, and I'll never\n",
      "forgive you as long as I live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside\n",
      "herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of\n",
      "the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard\n",
      "the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her\n",
      "sister.  Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her\n",
      "family as a literary sprout of great promise.  It was only half a dozen\n",
      "little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her\n",
      "whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to\n",
      "print.  She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the\n",
      "old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of\n",
      "several years.  It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a\n",
      "dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.\n",
      "Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her\n",
      "pet.  Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one\n",
      "would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now\n",
      "regretted more than any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable\n",
      "that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please forgive me, Jo.  I'm very, very sorry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never shall forgive you,\" was Jo's stern answer, and from that\n",
      "moment she ignored Amy entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had\n",

      "was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their\n",

      "wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed.  They felt this most\n",
      "when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a\n",
      "stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.  But in spite\n",
      "of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not\n",
      "seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, \"My\n",

      "\n",
      "Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her\n",
      "grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she\n",
      "felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't quite forgive yet.  So\n",
      "she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was\n",
      "listening, \"It was an abominable thing, and she doesn't deserve to be\n",
      "forgiven.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or\n",

      "was particularly exasperating.  Jo still looked like a thunder cloud,\n",
      "and nothing went well all day.  It was bitter cold in the morning, she\n",
      "dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack\n",
      "of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful\n",
      "when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were\n",
      "always talking about being good and yet wouldn't even try when other\n",
      "people set them a virtuous example.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating.  He is always\n",
      "kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\" said Jo to herself,\n",
      "and off she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient\n",
      "exclamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There!  She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice\n",
      "we shall have.  But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say that.  You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the\n",
      "loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and\n",
      "I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\" said Meg.  \"Go\n",
      "after them.  Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with\n",

      "\"I'll try,\" said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to\n",

      "the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached\n",
      "them.  Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.  Laurie did not see, for\n",
      "he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm\n",
      "spell had preceded the cold snap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before we\n",
      "begin to race,\" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a\n",
      "young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on\n",
      "her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and\n",
      "went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of\n",
      "satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till\n",
      "it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and\n",
      "feelings always do unless cast out at once.  As Laurie turned the bend,\n",
      "he shouted back...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep near the shore.  It isn't safe in the middle.\" Jo heard, but Amy\n",
      "was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word.  Jo glanced over\n",
      "her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,\n",
      "far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the\n",
      "river.  For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her\n",
      "heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her\n",
      "round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a\n",
      "sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made\n",
      "Jo's heart stand still with fear.  She tried to call Laurie, but her\n",
      "voice was gone.  She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have\n",
      "no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless,\n",
      "staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the\n",
      "black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried\n",
      "out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring a rail.  Quick, quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked\n",
      "as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,\n",
      "and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged\n",
      "a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more\n",
      "frightened than hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.  Pile our things on\n",
      "her, while I get off these confounded skates,\" cried Laurie, wrapping\n",
      "his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed\n",
      "so intricate before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an\n",
      "exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot\n",
      "fire.  During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,\n",
      "looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and\n",
      "her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When\n",
      "Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by\n",
      "the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure she is safe?\" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the\n",
      "golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever\n",
      "under the treacherous ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite safe, dear.  She is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,\n",
      "you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\" replied\n",
      "her mother cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie did it all.  I only let her go.  Mother, if she should die, it\n",
      "would be my fault.\"  And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of\n",
      "penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her\n",
      "hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the\n",
      "heavy punishment which might have come upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's my dreadful temper!  I try to cure it, I think I have, and then\n",
      "it breaks out worse than ever.  Oh, Mother, what shall I do?  What\n",
      "shall I do?\" cried poor Jo, in despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is\n",
      "impossible to conquer your fault,\" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy\n",
      "head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo\n",
      "cried even harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is!  It seems as if I could\n",
      "do anything when I'm in a passion.  I get so savage, I could hurt\n",
      "anyone and enjoy it.  I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some\n",
      "day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help\n",
      "me, do help me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, my child, I will.  Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this\n",
      "day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another\n",
      "like it.  Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than\n",
      "yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them.  You think\n",
      "your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yours, Mother?  Why, you are never angry!\"  And for the moment Jo\n",
      "forgot remorse in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded\n",
      "in controlling it.  I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I\n",
      "have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it,\n",
      "though it may take me another forty years to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a\n",
      "better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof.  She\n",
      "felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her.  The\n",
      "knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,\n",
      "made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it,\n",
      "though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a\n",
      "girl of fifteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go\n",
      "out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?\"\n",
      "asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and\n",
      "when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away\n",
      "for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and\n",
      "wicked,\" answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed\n",
      "and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you learn to keep still?  That is what troubles me, for the\n",
      "sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the more I say\n",
      "the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings and say\n",
      "dreadful things.  Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My good mother used to help me...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you do us...\" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years\n",
      "had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to\n",
      "anyone else.  I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears\n",
      "over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on.\n",
      "Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be\n",
      "good.  But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we\n",
      "were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by\n",
      "nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Mother!  What helped you then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father, Jo.  He never loses patience, never doubts or complains,\n",
      "but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed\n",
      "to do otherwise before him.  He helped and comforted me, and showed me\n",
      "that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little\n",
      "girls possess, for I was their example.  It was easier to try for your\n",
      "sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you\n",
      "when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,\n",
      "and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest\n",
      "reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them\n",
      "copy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\"\n",
      "cried Jo, much touched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch\n",
      "over your 'bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not\n",
      "spoil your life.  You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with\n",
      "heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you\n",
      "greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will try, Mother, I truly will.  But you must help me, remind me,\n",
      "and keep me from flying out.  I used to see Father sometimes put his\n",
      "finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face,\n",
      "and you always folded your lips tight and went away.  Was he reminding\n",
      "you then?\" asked Jo softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me\n",
      "from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as she\n",
      "spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,\n",
      "\"Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it?  I didn't mean to be\n",
      "rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so\n",
      "safe and happy here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest\n",
      "happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how\n",
      "much I love them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I'd grieved you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how\n",
      "much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his\n",
      "little daughters safe and good for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never\n",
      "complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\" said Jo, wondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was\n",
      "gone.  Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty\n",
      "and will surely be the happier for it in the end?  If I don't seem to\n",
      "need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to\n",
      "comfort and sustain me.  My child, the troubles and temptations of your\n",
      "life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive\n",
      "them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your\n",
      "Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.  The more you love\n",
      "and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will\n",
      "depend on human power and wisdom.  His love and care never tire or\n",
      "change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of\n",
      "lifelong peace, happiness, and strength.  Believe this heartily, and go\n",
      "to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as\n",
      "freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which\n",
      "followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart\n",
      "without words.  For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not\n",
      "only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of\n",
      "self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's hand, she had\n",
      "drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love\n",
      "stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once\n",
      "to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it\n",
      "had never worn before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I let the sun go down on my anger.  I wouldn't forgive her, and today,\n",
      "if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late!  How could I\n",
      "be so wicked?\" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister\n",
      "softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a\n",
      "smile that went straight to Jo's heart.  Neither said a word, but they\n",
      "hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was\n",
      "forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those\n",
      "children should have the measles just now,\" said Meg, one April day, as\n",
      "she stood packing the 'go abroady' trunk in her room, surrounded by her\n",
      "sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.  A whole\n",
      "fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\" replied Jo, looking like\n",
      "a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that,\" added Beth, tidily\n",
      "sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great\n",
      "occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice\n",
      "things,\" said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically\n",
      "replenished her sister's cushion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my\n",
      "adventures to tell you when I come back.  I'm sure it's the least I can\n",
      "do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get\n",
      "ready,\" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,\n",
      "which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?\" asked Amy, who had\n",
      "not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.\n",
      "March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when\n",
      "the proper time came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue\n",
      "sash.  I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make it over,\n",
      "so I must be contented with my old tarlaton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it\n",
      "off beautifully.  I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you\n",
      "might have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\n",
      "possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but\n",
      "Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\n",
      "and Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg.  \"Now, let me\n",
      "see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my\n",
      "hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks\n",
      "heavy for spring, doesn't it?  The violet silk would be so nice.  Oh,\n",
      "dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always\n",
      "look like an angel in white,\" said Amy, brooding over the little store\n",
      "of finery in which her soul delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to\n",
      "do.  My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\n",
      "I feel as if I'd got a new one.  My silk sacque isn't a bit the\n",
      "fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's.  I didn't like to\n",
      "say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.  I told\n",
      "Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one\n",
      "with a yellowish handle.  It's strong and neat, so I ought not to\n",
      "complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one\n",
      "with a gold top,\" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great\n",
      "disfavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Change it,\" advised Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much\n",
      "pains to get my things.  It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not\n",
      "going to give up to it.  My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves\n",
      "are my comfort.  You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.  I feel so rich\n",
      "and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up\n",
      "for common.\"  And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put\n",
      "some on mine?\" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\n",
      "fresh from Hannah's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns without\n",
      "any trimming on them.  Poor folks shouldn't rig,\" said Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my\n",
      "clothes and bows on my caps?\" said Meg impatiently.\n",

      "\"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only\n",
      "go to Annie Moffat's,\" observed Beth in her quiet way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I did!  Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if\n",
      "the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it?  There now, the trays\n",
      "are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for\n",
      "Mother to pack,\" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the\n",
      "half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,\n",
      "which she called her 'ball dress' with an important air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of\n",
      "novelty and pleasure.  Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\n",
      "reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\n",
      "than she went.  But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take\n",
      "good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a\n",
      "winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went\n",
      "to take her first taste of fashionable life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,\n",
      "at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its\n",
      "occupants.  But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life\n",
      "they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,\n",
      "without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated\n",
      "or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite\n",
      "conceal the ordinary material of which they were made.  It certainly\n",
      "was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her\n",
      "best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.  It suited her\n",
      "exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\n",
      "those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\n",
      "crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as\n",
      "well as she could.  The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things,\n",
      "the more she envied her and sighed to be rich.  Home now looked bare\n",
      "and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she\n",
      "felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of\n",
      "the new gloves and silk stockings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\n",
      "were busily employed in 'having a good time'.  They shopped, walked,\n",
      "rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at\n",
      "home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to\n",
      "entertain them.  Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\n",
      "was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.\n",
      "Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and\n",
      "Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as\n",
      "her daughter had done.  Everyone petted her, and 'Daisey', as they\n",
      "called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin\n",
      "wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses\n",
      "and making themselves very fine indeed.  So out came the tarlatan,\n",
      "looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new\n",
      "one.  Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\n",
      "cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud.\n",
      "No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\n",
      "Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\n",
      "arms.  But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\n",
      "heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others\n",
      "laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.  The hard,\n",
      "bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box\n",
      "of flowers.  Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all\n",
      "were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are\n",
      "altogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are for Miss March, the man said.  And here's a note,\" put in the\n",
      "maid, holding it to Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What fun!  Who are they from?  Didn't know you had a lover,\" cried the\n",
      "girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg\n",
      "simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed!\" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\n",
      "into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\n",
      "pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\n",
      "cheered her up by their beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\n",
      "herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\n",
      "breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\n",
      "Clara, the elder sister, told her she was 'the sweetest little thing\n",
      "she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.\n",
      "Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest\n",
      "went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\n",
      "face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and\n",
      "fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very\n",
      "shabby now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\n",
      "heart's content.  Everyone was very kind, and she had three\n",
      "compliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a\n",
      "remarkably fine voice.  Major Lincoln asked who 'the fresh little girl\n",
      "with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with\n",
      "her because she 'didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her', as he\n",
      "gracefully expressed it.  So altogether she had a very nice time, till\n",
      "she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.\n",
      "She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner\n",
      "to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of\n",
      "the flowery wall...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How old is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?  Sallie\n",
      "says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. M.  has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,\n",
      "early as it is.  The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Moffat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up\n",
      "when the flowers came quite prettily.  Poor thing! She'd be so nice if\n",
      "she was only got up in style.  Do you think she'd be offended if we\n",
      "offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\" asked another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlaton\n",
      "is all she has got.  She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good\n",
      "excuse for offering a decent one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and\n",
      "rather agitated.  She was proud, and her pride was useful just then,\n",
      "for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what\n",
      "she had just heard.  For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she\n",
      "could not help understanding the gossip of her friends.  She tried to\n",
      "forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M.  has\n",
      "made her plans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlaton,\" till\n",
      "she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for\n",
      "advice.  As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and\n",
      "being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an\n",
      "effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she\n",
      "was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till\n",
      "her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.\n",
      "Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and\n",
      "much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived\n",
      "as happily as a child.  Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled\n",
      "by the silly speeches she had overheard.  Her faith in her mother was a\n",
      "little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat,\n",
      "who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be\n",
      "contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter\n",
      "was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby\n",
      "dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\n",
      "resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\n",
      "speaking out frankly and setting everything right.  Everybody dawdled\n",
      "that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\n",
      "to take up their worsted work.  Something in the manner of her friends\n",
      "struck Meg at once.  They treated her with more respect, she thought,\n",
      "took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\n",
      "eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.  All this surprised and flattered\n",
      "her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from\n",
      "her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for\n",
      "Thursday.  We should like to know him, and it's only a proper\n",
      "compliment to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply\n",
      "demurely, \"You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not, Cherie?\" asked Miss Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's too old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My child, what do you mean?  What is his age, I beg to know!\" cried\n",
      "Miss Clara.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearly seventy, I believe,\" answered Meg, counting stitches to hide\n",
      "the merriment in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You sly creature!  Of course we meant the young man,\" exclaimed Miss\n",
      "Belle, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy.\"  And Meg laughed also\n",
      "at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her\n",
      "supposed lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About your age,\" Nan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August,\" returned Meg,\n",
      "tossing her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?\" said Annie,\n",
      "looking wise about nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are\n",
      "so fond of them.  My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,\n",
      "so it is quite natural that we children should play together,\" and Meg\n",
      "hoped they would say no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,\" said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\" returned Miss Belle\n",
      "with a shrug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls.  Can I do\n",
      "anything for you, young ladies?\" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like\n",
      "an elephant in silk and lace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you, ma'am,\" replied Sallie.  \"I've got my new pink silk for\n",
      "Thursday and don't want a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I...\" began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she\n",
      "did want several things and could not have them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall you wear?\" asked Sallie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly\n",
      "torn last night,\" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling\n",
      "very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you send home for another?\" said Sallie, who was not an\n",
      "observing young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any other.\"  It cost Meg an effort to say that, but\n",
      "Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, \"Only that?\n",
      "How funny...\"  She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head\n",
      "at her and broke in, saying kindly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.  Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she\n",
      "isn't out yet?  There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had\n",
      "a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown,\n",
      "and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't, it does\n",
      "well enough for a little girl like me,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to\n",
      "do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and\n",
      "there.  I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and then we'll\n",
      "burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,\"\n",
      "said Belle in her persuasive tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if\n",
      "she would be 'a little beauty' after touching up caused her to accept\n",
      "and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and\n",
      "between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.  They crimped and curled\n",
      "her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\n",
      "touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense\n",
      "would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled.  They\n",
      "laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\n",
      "breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\n",
      "the mirror.  A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\n",
      "brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink\n",
      "silk which did not show.  A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and\n",
      "a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,\n",
      "and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her\n",
      "heart.  A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder\n",
      "holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\n",
      "satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?\" cried Hortense,\n",
      "clasping her hands in an affected rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\n",
      "where the others were waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings\n",
      "tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\n",
      "fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\n",
      "she was 'a little beauty'.  Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\n",
      "enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in\n",
      "the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like\n",
      "a party of magpies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt\n",
      "and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.  Take your silver\n",
      "butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,\n",
      "Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\"\n",
      "said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere\n",
      "beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I\n",
      "assure you.  Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of them, and be\n",
      "sure you don't trip,\" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was\n",
      "prettier than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs\n",
      "and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early\n",
      "guests were assembled.  She very soon discovered that there is a charm\n",
      "about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures\n",
      "their respect.  Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her\n",
      "before, were very affectionate all of a sudden.  Several young\n",
      "gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only\n",
      "stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but\n",
      "agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,\n",
      "and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air\n",
      "of interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Daisy March—father a colonel in the army—one of our first families,\n",
      "but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;\n",
      "sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another\n",
      "observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been\n",
      "rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs. The 'queer feeling' did not pass\n",
      "away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so\n",
      "got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the\n",
      "train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest\n",
      "her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.  She was flirting\n",
      "her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried\n",
      "to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused,\n",
      "for just opposite, she saw Laurie.  He was staring at her with\n",
      "undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he\n",
      "bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and\n",
      "wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle\n",
      "nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to\n",
      "see, looked unusually boyish and shy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.  I won't care for\n",
      "it, or let it change me a bit,\" thought Meg, and rustled across the\n",
      "room to shake hands with her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't.\" she said, with her most\n",
      "grown-up air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,\" answered\n",
      "Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her\n",
      "maternal tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall you tell her?\" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his\n",
      "opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike\n",
      "yourself, I'm quite afraid of you,\" he said, fumbling at his glove\n",
      "button.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How absurd of you!  The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like\n",
      "it.  Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?\" said Meg, bent on making him say\n",
      "whether he thought her improved or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I think she would,\" returned Laurie gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you like me so?\" asked Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" was the blunt reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" in an anxious tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically\n",
      "trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,\n",
      "which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like fuss and feathers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg\n",
      "walked away, saying petulantly, \"You are the rudest boy I ever saw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool\n",
      "her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant\n",
      "color.  As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after\n",
      "she heard him saying to his mother...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are making a fool of that little girl.  I wanted you to see her,\n",
      "but they have spoiled her entirely.  She's nothing but a doll tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Meg.  \"I wish I'd been sensible and worn my own\n",

      "She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the\n",
      "curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some\n",
      "one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he\n",
      "said, with his very best bow and his hand out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\" said Meg, trying to\n",
      "look offended and failing entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it.  Come, I'll be good. I don't like\n",
      "your gown, but I do think you are just splendid.\" And he waved his\n",
      "hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch\n",
      "the time, \"Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up.  It's the plague of\n",
      "my life and I was a goose to wear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\" said Laurie,\n",
      "looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home,\n",
      "they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant\n",
      "sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more\n",
      "friendly than ever after their small tiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?\" said Meg, as he stood\n",
      "fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she\n",
      "would not own why.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't I!\" said Laurie, with alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won't\n",
      "understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why did you do it?\" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg\n",
      "hastily added...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall tell them myself all about it, and 'fess' to Mother how silly\n",
      "I've been.  But I'd rather do it myself.  So you'll not tell, will you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other?  You\n",
      "don't look as if you were having a good time.  Are you?\" And Laurie\n",
      "looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not just now.  Don't think I'm horrid.  I only wanted a little\n",
      "fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here comes Ned Moffat.  What does he want?\" said Laurie, knitting his\n",
      "black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a\n",
      "pleasant addition to the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for\n",
      "them.  What a bore!\" said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused\n",
      "Laurie immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking\n",
      "champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving 'like a\n",
      "pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort\n",
      "of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a\n",
      "defender was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that.\n",
      "I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know,\" he whispered,\n",
      "leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher\n",
      "stooped to pick up her fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not Meg tonight, I'm 'a doll' who does all sorts of crazy things.\n",
      "Tomorrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers' and be desperately\n",
      "good again,\" she answered with an affected little laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wish tomorrow was here, then,\" muttered Laurie, walking off,\n",
      "ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.\n",
      "After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly\n",
      "upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that\n",
      "scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture.  But he got\n",
      "no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\n",
      "good night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember!\" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\n",
      "already begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence a la mort,\" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as\n",
      "he went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was too\n",
      "tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a\n",
      "masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.  She was\n",
      "sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with\n",
      "her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had 'sat in the lap of luxury'\n",
      "long enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all\n",
      "the time.  Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,\" said Meg,\n",
      "looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother\n",
      "and Jo on the Sunday evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem\n",
      "dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,\" replied her mother, who\n",
      "had given her many anxious looks that day.  For motherly eyes are quick\n",
      "to see any change in children's faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a\n",
      "charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her\n",
      "spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat\n",
      "thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.\n",
      "As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her\n",
      "chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee,\n",
      "saying bravely...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marmee, I want to 'fess'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so.  What is it, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I go away?\" asked Jo discreetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not.  Don't I always tell you everything?  I was ashamed to\n",
      "speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the\n",
      "dreadful things I did at the Moffats'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are prepared,\" said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little\n",
      "anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they\n",
      "powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a\n",
      "fashion-plate.  Laurie thought I wasn't proper.  I know he did, though\n",
      "he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'.  I knew it was silly,\n",
      "but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of\n",
      "nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast\n",
      "face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to\n",
      "blame her little follies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was\n",
      "altogether abominable,\" said Meg self-reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is something more, I think.\"  And Mrs. March smoothed the soft\n",
      "cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have\n",
      "people say and think such things about us and Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats',\n",
      "and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill\n",
      "pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\" cried Jo\n",
      "indignantly.  \"Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the spot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me.  I couldn't help hearing at\n",
      "first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I\n",
      "ought to go away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle\n",
      "such ridiculous stuff.  The idea of having 'plans' and being kind to\n",
      "Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by!  Won't he shout\n",
      "when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\"\n",
      "And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good\n",
      "joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you!  She mustn't, must she,\n",
      "Mother?\" said Meg, looking distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you\n",
      "can,\" said Mrs. March gravely.  \"I was very unwise to let you go among\n",
      "people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly,\n",
      "ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people.  I am more\n",
      "sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,\n",
      "Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me.  I'll forget all the bad and\n",
      "remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you\n",
      "very much for letting me go.  I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,\n",
      "Mother.  I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till\n",
      "I'm fit to take care of myself.  But it is nice to be praised and\n",
      "admired, and I can't help saying I like it,\" said Meg, looking half\n",
      "ashamed of the confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not\n",
      "become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.\n",
      "Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite\n",
      "the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty,\n",
      "Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind\n",
      "her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new\n",
      "thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and\n",
      "things of that sort.  And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her\n",
      "sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a\n",
      "world where she could not follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, do you have 'plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?\" asked Meg bashfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ\n",
      "somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect.  I will tell you some of them,\n",
      "for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and\n",
      "heart of yours right, on a very serious subject.  You are young, Meg,\n",
      "but not too young to understand me, and mothers' lips are the fittest\n",
      "to speak of such things to girls like you.  Jo, your turn will come in\n",
      "time, perhaps, so listen to my 'plans' and help me carry them out, if\n",
      "they are good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they\n",
      "were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,\n",
      "and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her\n",
      "serious yet cheery way...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be\n",
      "admired, loved, and respected.  To have a happy youth, to be well and\n",
      "wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care\n",
      "and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen\n",
      "by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a\n",
      "woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful\n",
      "experience.  It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait\n",
      "for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes,\n",
      "you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy.  My dear\n",
      "girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the\n",
      "world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid\n",
      "houses, which are not homes because love is wanting.  Money is a\n",
      "needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I\n",
      "never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for.\n",
      "I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved,\n",
      "contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put\n",
      "themselves forward,\" sighed Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then we'll be old maids,\" said Jo stoutly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right, Jo.  Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or\n",
      "unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,\" said Mrs. March\n",
      "decidedly.  \"Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere\n",
      "lover.  Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls,\n",
      "but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave\n",
      "these things to time.  Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for\n",
      "homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they\n",
      "are not.  One thing remember, my girls.  Mother is always ready to be\n",
      "your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust\n",
      "that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and\n",
      "comfort of our lives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will, Marmee, we will!\" cried both, with all their hearts, as she\n",
      "bade them good night.\n",
      "\n",
      "As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the\n",
      "lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.\n",
      "The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the\n",
      "little plot to do what she liked with.  Hannah used to say, \"I'd know\n",
      "which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny,\" and so\n",
      "she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.\n",
      "Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.\n",
      "Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying\n",
      "experiments.  This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the\n",
      "seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt\n",
      "Cockle-top and her family of chicks.  Beth had old-fashioned fragrant\n",
      "flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,\n",
      "pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for\n",
      "the pussies.  Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but\n",
      "very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging\n",
      "their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall\n",
      "white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants\n",
      "as would consent to blossom there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine\n",
      "days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some\n",
      "new, all more or less original.  One of these was the 'P.C.', for as\n",
      "secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one,\n",
      "and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the\n",
      "Pickwick Club.  With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a\n",
      "year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which\n",
      "occasions the ceremonies were as follows:  Three chairs were arranged\n",
      "in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges,\n",
      "with a big 'P.C.' in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper\n",
      "called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something,\n",
      "while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven\n",
      "o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges\n",
      "round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity.  Meg, as\n",
      "the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus\n",
      "Snodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,\n",
      "who was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.\n",
      "Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original\n",
      "tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which\n",
      "they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short\n",
      "comings.  On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles\n",
      "without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared\n",
      "hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he\n",
      "arranged himself properly, began to read:\n",
      "\n",
      "As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave to\n",
      "assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls\n",
      "once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass\n",
      "rose to make a proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. President and gentlemen,\" he began, assuming a parliamentary\n",
      "attitude and tone, \"I wish to propose the admission of a new\n",
      "member—one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for\n",
      "it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary\n",
      "value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice.  I propose Mr.\n",
      "Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P.  C.  Come now, do\n",
      "have him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather\n",
      "anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll put it to a vote,\" said the President.  \"All in favor of this\n",
      "motion please to manifest it by saying, 'Aye'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's surprise, by a\n",
      "timid one from Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Contrary-minded say, 'No'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great\n",
      "elegance, \"We don't wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about.\n",
      "This is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and proper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,\"\n",
      "observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she\n",
      "always did when doubtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.  \"Sir, I give you my word as a\n",
      "gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort.  He likes to write,\n",
      "and he'll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being\n",
      "sentimental, don't you see?  We can do so little for him, and he does\n",
      "so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place\n",
      "here, and make him welcome if he comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,\n",
      "looking as if he had quite made up his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid.  I say he may come, and\n",
      "his grandpa, too, if he likes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her\n",
      "seat to shake hands approvingly.  \"Now then, vote again. Everybody\n",
      "remember it's our Laurie, and say, 'Aye!'\" cried Snodgrass excitedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye!  Aye!  Aye!\" replied three voices at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!  Bless you!  Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by the\n",
      "fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present\n",
      "the new member.\"  And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw\n",
      "open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag,\n",
      "flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You rogue!  You traitor!  Jo, how could you?\" cried the three girls,\n",
      "as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a\n",
      "chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,\" began Mr. Pickwick,\n",
      "trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an\n",
      "amiable smile.  But the new member was equal to the occasion, and\n",
      "rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most\n",
      "engaging manner, \"Mr. President and ladies—I beg pardon,\n",
      "gentlemen—allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble\n",
      "servant of the club.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!  Good!\" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming\n",
      "pan on which she leaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My faithful friend and noble patron,\" continued Laurie with a wave of\n",
      "the hand, \"who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed\n",
      "for the base stratagem of tonight.  I planned it, and she only gave in\n",
      "after lots of teasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself.  You know I proposed the\n",
      "cupboard,\" broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind what she says.  I'm the wretch that did it, sir,\" said the\n",
      "new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.  \"But on my honor,\n",
      "I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest\n",
      "of this immortal club.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear!  Hear!\" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a\n",
      "cymbal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on, go on!\" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed\n",
      "benignly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the\n",
      "honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between\n",
      "adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the\n",
      "lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on\n",
      "the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I\n",
      "may be allowed the expression.  It's the old martin house, but I've\n",
      "stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts\n",
      "of things, and save our valuable time.  Letters, manuscripts, books,\n",
      "and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it\n",
      "will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.  Allow me to present the club key,\n",
      "and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and\n",
      "subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some\n",
      "time before order could be restored.  A long discussion followed, and\n",
      "everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best.  So it was an\n",
      "unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it\n",
      "broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,\n",
      "well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did\n",
      "add 'spirit' to the meetings, and 'a tone' to the paper, for his\n",
      "orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,\n",
      "being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never\n",
      "sentimental.  Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or\n",
      "Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "The P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished\n",
      "wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as\n",
      "through the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and\n",
      "pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,\n",
      "invitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman liked the fun,\n",
      "and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and\n",
      "funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's\n",
      "charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care.  How they laughed\n",
      "when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that\n",
      "little post office would hold in the years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first of June!  The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and\n",
      "I'm free.  Three months' vacation—how I shall enjoy it!\" exclaimed\n",
      "Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an\n",
      "unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and\n",
      "Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!\" said Jo. \"I was\n",
      "mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her.  If she had, I should have\n",
      "felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a\n",
      "churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry\n",
      "getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to\n",
      "me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly\n",
      "helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me.\n",
      "I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,\n",
      "for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josyphine, won't\n",
      "you—?' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.  I did\n",
      "actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor old Jo!  She came in looking as if bears were after her,\" said\n",
      "Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\" observed Amy, tasting\n",
      "her mixture critically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter.  It's too warm\n",
      "to be particular about one's parts of speech,\" murmured Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall you do all your vacation?\" asked Amy, changing the subject\n",
      "with tact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\" replied Meg, from the depths\n",
      "of the rocking chair.  \"I've been routed up early all winter and had to\n",
      "spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going to rest and\n",
      "revel to my heart's content.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Jo, \"that dozy way wouldn't suit me.  I've laid in a heap of\n",
      "books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in\n",
      "the old apple tree, when I'm not having l——\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say 'larks!'\" implored Amy, as a return snub for the 'samphire'\n",
      "correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll say 'nightingales' then, with Laurie.  That's proper and\n",
      "appropriate, since he's a warbler.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time\n",
      "and rest, as the girls mean to,\" proposed Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind.  I want to learn some new songs,\n",
      "and my children need fitting up for the summer.  They are dreadfully\n",
      "out of order and really suffering for clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May we, Mother?\" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in\n",
      "what they called 'Marmee's corner'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it.  I\n",
      "think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as\n",
      "bad as all work and no play.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, no!  It will be delicious, I'm sure,\" said Meg complacently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp', says.\n",
      "Fun forever, and no grubbing!\" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the\n",
      "lemonade went round.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the\n",
      "rest of the day.  Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock.\n",
      "Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely\n",
      "and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and\n",
      "Amy's books lay scattered about.  Nothing was neat and pleasant but\n",
      "'Marmee's corner', which looked as usual.  And there Meg sat, to 'rest\n",
      "and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses\n",
      "she would get with her salary.  Jo spent the morning on the river with\n",
      "Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide\n",
      "World, up in the apple tree.  Beth began by rummaging everything out\n",
      "of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before\n",
      "half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her\n",
      "music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her\n",
      "bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to\n",
      "draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who\n",
      "the young artist was.  As no one appeared but an inquisitive\n",
      "daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk,\n",
      "got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.\n",
      "\n",
      "At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a\n",
      "delightful, though unusually long day.  Meg, who went shopping in the\n",
      "afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she had\n",
      "cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her\n",
      "slightly cross.  Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a\n",
      "raging headache by reading too long.  Beth was worried by the confusion\n",
      "of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\n",
      "once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\n",
      "Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she\n",
      "had 'nothing to wear'.  But these were mere trifles, and they assured\n",
      "their mother that the experiment was working finely.  She smiled, said\n",
      "nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home\n",
      "pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly.  It was\n",
      "astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was\n",
      "produced by the 'resting and reveling' process.  The days kept getting\n",
      "longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were\n",
      "tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found\n",
      "plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do.  As the height of luxury,\n",
      "Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,\n",
      "that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to\n",
      "furbish them up a la Moffat.  Jo read till her eyes gave out and she\n",
      "was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a\n",
      "quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished\n",
      "she had gone with Aunt March.  Beth got on pretty well, for she was\n",
      "constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell\n",
      "back into her old ways now and then.  But something in the air affected\n",
      "her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so\n",
      "that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her\n",
      "she was 'a fright'.  Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were\n",
      "small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found\n",
      "that accomplished and important little self a great burden.  She didn't\n",
      "like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the\n",
      "time.  Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless\n",
      "very well conducted.  \"If one could have a fine house, full of nice\n",
      "girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at\n",
      "home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try\n",
      "the patience of a Boaz,\" complained Miss Malaprop, after several days\n",
      "devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday\n",
      "night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was\n",
      "nearly done.  Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who\n",
      "had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an\n",
      "appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls\n",
      "enjoy the full effect of the play system.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,\n",
      "no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on us!  What has happened?\" cried Jo, staring about her in\n",
      "dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather\n",
      "bewildered, and a little ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay\n",
      "quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.  It's a very\n",
      "queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself.  But she\n",
      "says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble but take\n",
      "care of ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something to\n",
      "do, that is, some new amusement, you know,\" added Jo quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and\n",
      "they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's\n",
      "saying, \"Housekeeping ain't no joke.\"  There was plenty of food in the\n",
      "larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,\n",
      "wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think\n",
      "of her, for she'd take care of herself,\" said Meg, who presided and\n",
      "felt quite matronly behind the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the\n",
      "cook's compliments.  The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet\n",
      "scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March\n",
      "received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo\n",
      "was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they\n",
      "won't suffer, and it will do them good,\" she said, producing the more\n",
      "palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of\n",
      "the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly\n",
      "little deception for which they were grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook\n",
      "at her failures.  \"Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be servant, you\n",
      "be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,\" said\n",
      "Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the\n",
      "parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the\n",
      "sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting.  Jo, with\n",
      "perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the\n",
      "quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having\n",
      "company,\" said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some\n",
      "asparagus and a lobster, 'for a relish', as Hannah says. We'll have\n",
      "lettuce and make a salad.  I don't know how, but the book tells.  I'll\n",
      "have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you\n",
      "want to be elegant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but\n",
      "gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.  I wash my hands of the\n",
      "dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own\n",
      "responsibility, you may just take care of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the\n",
      "pudding.  You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?\"\n",
      "asked Jo, rather hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few trifles.  You\n",
      "had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything,\" returned Meg\n",
      "prudently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I shall.  I'm not a fool.\"  And Jo went off in a huff at the\n",
      "doubts expressed of her powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get what you like, and don't disturb me.  I'm going out to dinner and\n",
      "can't worry about things at home,\" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to\n",
      "her.  \"I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation\n",
      "today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and\n",
      "reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural\n",
      "phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic\n",
      "eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything is out of sorts, somehow,\" she said to herself, going\n",
      "downstairs.  \"There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that something is\n",
      "wrong in this family.  If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to\n",
      "find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with\n",
      "his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for\n",
      "want of which he had died.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a drop left.\n",
      "Oh, Pip!  Oh, Pip!  How could I be so cruel to you?\" cried Beth, taking\n",
      "the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding\n",
      "him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a\n",
      "coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,\" said Amy\n",
      "hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead.  I'll make\n",
      "him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll never have\n",
      "another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,\" murmured\n",
      "Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.  Now, don't\n",
      "cry, Bethy.  It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has\n",
      "had the worst of the experiment.  Make the shroud, and lay him in my\n",
      "box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice little funeral,\"\n",
      "said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which\n",
      "was in a most discouraging state of confusion.  Putting on a big apron,\n",
      "she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when\n",
      "she discovered that the fire was out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a sweet prospect!\" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,\n",
      "and poking vigorously among the cinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the\n",
      "water heated.  The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself\n",
      "that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a\n",
      "very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid\n",
      "strawberries.  By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and\n",
      "the stove was red-hot.  Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had\n",
      "worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and\n",
      "forgotten it.  Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when\n",
      "the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure\n",
      "appeared, demanding tartly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high\n",
      "as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the\n",
      "sour bread into the oven without further delay.  Mrs. March went out,\n",
      "after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a\n",
      "word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear\n",
      "departed lay in state in the domino box.  A strange sense of\n",
      "helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the\n",
      "corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker\n",
      "appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.  Now this lady was a thin,\n",
      "yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw\n",
      "everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had\n",
      "been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and\n",
      "had few friends.  So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain\n",
      "her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories\n",
      "of the people whom she knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions\n",
      "which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a\n",
      "standing joke.  Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,\n",
      "and discovered that something more than energy and good will is\n",
      "necessary to make a cook.  She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was\n",
      "grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.\n",
      "The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that\n",
      "she could not make it fit to eat.  The lobster was a scarlet mystery to\n",
      "her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager\n",
      "proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.  The potatoes had\n",
      "to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at\n",
      "the last.  The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe\n",
      "as they looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only\n",
      "it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\"\n",
      "thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and\n",
      "stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before\n",
      "Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose\n",
      "tattling tongue would report them far and wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after\n",
      "another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,\n",
      "Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all\n",
      "his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene.  Jo's one\n",
      "strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a\n",
      "pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.  Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle,\n",
      "and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and\n",
      "everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea\n",
      "of cream.  Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some\n",
      "water hastily.  Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,\n",
      "for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but\n",
      "he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his\n",
      "mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate.  Amy, who was fond of\n",
      "delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her\n",
      "napkin, and left the table precipitately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what is it?\" exclaimed Jo, trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,\" replied Meg with a\n",
      "tragic gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had\n",
      "given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes\n",
      "on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the\n",
      "refrigerator.  She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when\n",
      "she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic\n",
      "efforts.  The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she\n",
      "laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.  So did everyone else, even\n",
      "'Croaker' as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner\n",
      "ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober\n",
      "ourselves with a funeral,\" said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made\n",
      "ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's\n",
      "dinner table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did sober themselves for Beth's sake.  Laurie dug a grave under\n",
      "the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his\n",
      "tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of\n",
      "violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,\n",
      "composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Here lies Pip March,\n",
      "    Who died the 7th of June;\n",
      "    Loved and lamented sore,\n",
      "    And not forgotten soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome\n",
      "with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the\n",
      "beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up\n",
      "the pillows and putting things in order.  Meg helped Jo clear away the\n",
      "remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so\n",
      "tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour\n",
      "cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.  Mrs. March came\n",
      "home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the\n",
      "afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success\n",
      "of one part of the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was\n",
      "a scramble to get ready to see them.  Then tea must be got, errands\n",
      "done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last\n",
      "minute.  As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on\n",
      "the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each\n",
      "groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a dreadful day this has been!\" began Jo, usually the first to\n",
      "speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit like home,\" added Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,\" sighed Beth, glancing\n",
      "with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you\n",
      "want it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as\n",
      "if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another\n",
      "week of it?\" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned\n",
      "toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't!\" cried Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" echoed the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a\n",
      "little for others, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lounging and larking doesn't pay,\" observed Jo, shaking her head. \"I'm\n",
      "tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose you learn plain cooking.  That's a useful accomplishment,\n",
      "which no woman should be without,\" said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly\n",
      "at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker\n",
      "and heard her account of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd\n",
      "get on?\" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing\n",
      "her share faithfully.  While Hannah and I did your work, you got on\n",
      "pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable.  So I\n",
      "thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when\n",
      "everyone thinks only of herself.  Don't you feel that it is pleasanter\n",
      "to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when\n",
      "it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and\n",
      "lovely to us all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do, Mother, we do!\" cried the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for\n",
      "though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as\n",
      "we learn to carry them.  Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for\n",
      "everyone.  It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and\n",
      "spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than\n",
      "money or fashion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\"I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner\n",
      "party I have shall be a success.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,\n",
      "Marmee.  I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing. That will be\n",
      "better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as\n",
      "they are.\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music\n",
      "and dolls.  I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not\n",
      "playing,\" was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example by\n",
      "heroically declaring, \"I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to\n",
      "my parts of speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good!  Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy\n",
      "that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other extreme\n",
      "and delve like slaves.  Have regular hours for work and play, make each\n",
      "day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth\n",
      "of time by employing it well.  Then youth will be delightful, old age\n",
      "will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite\n",
      "of poverty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll remember, Mother!\" and they did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it\n",
      "regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door\n",
      "and distributing the mail.  One July day she came in with her hands\n",
      "full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the\n",
      "penny post.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's your posy, Mother!  Laurie never forgets that,\" she said,\n",
      "putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in 'Marmee's corner',\n",
      "and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering\n",
      "the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching\n",
      "wristbands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg,\n",
      "looking at the gray cotton glove.  \"Didn't you drop the other in the\n",
      "garden?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate to have odd gloves!  Never mind, the other may be found.  My\n",
      "letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted.  I think Mr.\n",
      "Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\n",
      "morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and\n",
      "very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy\n",
      "white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she\n",
      "sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied\n",
      "with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt,\n",
      "that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\n",
      "the whole post office and stuck outside,\" said Beth, laughing as she\n",
      "went into the study where Jo sat writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a sly fellow Laurie is!  I said I wished bigger hats were the\n",
      "fashion, because I burn my face every hot day.  He said, 'Why mind the\n",
      "fashion?  Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had\n",
      "one, and he has sent me this, to try me.  I'll wear it for fun, and\n",
      "show him I don't care for the fashion.\"  And hanging the antique\n",
      "broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\n",
      "to her...\n",
      "\n",
      "My Dear:\n",
      "\n",
      "I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch\n",
      "your efforts to control your temper.  You say nothing about your\n",
      "trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees\n",
      "them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the\n",
      "well-worn cover of your guidebook.  I, too, have seen them all, and\n",
      "heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins\n",
      "to bear fruit.  Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe\n",
      "that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That does me good!  That's worth millions of money and pecks of\n",
      "praise.  Oh, Marmee, I do try!  I will keep on trying, and not get\n",
      "tired, since I have you to help me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy\n",
      "tears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts\n",
      "to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,\n",
      "because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most\n",
      "valued.  Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon,\n",
      "she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest\n",
      "she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite\n",
      "ready for either good or bad news.  In a big, dashing hand, Laurie\n",
      "wrote...\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Jo, What ho!\n",
      "\n",
      "Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to\n",
      "have a jolly time.  If it's fine, I'm going to pitch my tent in\n",
      "Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet—have a\n",
      "fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks.  They are\n",
      "nice people, and like such things.  Brooke will go to keep us boys\n",
      "steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls.  I want you\n",
      "all to come, can't let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry\n",
      "her.  Don't bother about rations, I'll see to that and everything else,\n",
      "only do come, there's a good fellow!\n",
      "\n",
      "In a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's richness!\" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course we can go, Mother?  It will be such a help to Laurie, for I\n",
      "can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some\n",
      "way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.  Do you know anything\n",
      "about them, Jo?\" asked Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only that there are four of them.  Kate is older than you, Fred and\n",
      "Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\n",
      "ten.  Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.  I fancied, from the\n",
      "way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire\n",
      "Kate much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing and so\n",
      "becoming!\" observed Meg complacently.  \"Have you anything decent, Jo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me.  I shall row and\n",
      "tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of.  You'll come,\n",
      "Betty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you won't let any boys talk to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a boy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so\n",
      "kind.  But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work\n",
      "hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll\n",
      "go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's my good girl.  You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love\n",
      "you for it.  Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a cheery word\n",
      "kind of gives a lift.  Thank you, Mother,\" And Jo gave the thin cheek a\n",
      "grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back\n",
      "the rosy roundness of her youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,\"\n",
      "said Amy, showing her mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to\n",
      "him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,\" added Beth,\n",
      "whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play\n",
      "tomorrow with free minds,\" said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a\n",
      "broom.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to promise\n",
      "them a fine day, he saw a comical sight.  Each had made such\n",
      "preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an\n",
      "extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously\n",
      "anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to\n",
      "bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had\n",
      "capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the\n",
      "offending feature.  It was one of the kind artists use to hold the\n",
      "paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and\n",
      "effective for the purpose it was now being put.  This funny spectacle\n",
      "appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo\n",
      "woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\n",
      "lively bustle began in both houses.  Beth, who was ready first, kept\n",
      "reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by\n",
      "frequent telegrams from the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There goes the man with the tent!  I see Mrs. Barker doing up the\n",
      "lunch in a hamper and a great basket.  Now Mr. Laurence is looking up\n",
      "at the sky and the weathercock.  I wish he would go too.  There's\n",
      "Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy!  Oh, mercy me!  Here's a\n",
      "carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful\n",
      "boys.  One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell\n",
      "us that.  Be quick, girls!  It's getting late. Why, there is Ned\n",
      "Moffat, I do declare.  Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day\n",
      "when we were shopping?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is.  How queer that he should come.  I thought he was at the\n",
      "mountains.  There is Sallie.  I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all\n",
      "right, Jo?\" cried Meg in a flutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A regular daisy.  Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it\n",
      "looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff.\n",
      "Now then, come on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat?  It's too absurd!\n",
      "You shall not make a guy of yourself,\" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied\n",
      "down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie\n",
      "had sent for a joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big. It\n",
      "will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.\" With\n",
      "that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little\n",
      "band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy\n",
      "faces under the jaunty hatbrims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial\n",
      "manner.  The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a\n",
      "lively scene was enacted there.  Meg was grateful to see that Miss\n",
      "Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls\n",
      "would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's\n",
      "assurances that he came especially to see her.  Jo understood why\n",
      "Laurie 'primmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young\n",
      "lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with\n",
      "the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.  Beth took an\n",
      "observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not\n",
      "'dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that\n",
      "account.  Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and\n",
      "after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly\n",
      "became very good friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\n",
      "party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving\n",
      "Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore.  Laurie and Jo rowed one\n",
      "boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous\n",
      "twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a\n",
      "disturbed water bug.  Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it\n",

      "Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with\n",
      "the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with\n",
      "uncommon 'skill and dexterity'.  Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\n",
      "man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice.  Meg liked his\n",
      "quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful\n",
      "knowledge.  He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good\n",
      "deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.  Ned,\n",
      "being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it\n",
      "their bounden duty to assume.  He was not very wise, but very\n",
      "good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.\n",
      "Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and\n",

      "It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets\n",
      "down by the time they arrived.  A pleasant green field, with three\n",

      "croquet.\n",

      "\"Welcome to Camp Laurence!\" said the young host, as they landed with\n",
      "exclamations of delight.\n",

      "\n",
      "Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\n",

      "Jo, and Ned.  The English played well, but the Americans played better,\n",
      "and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of\n",
      "'76 inspired them.  Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once\n",
      "narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had\n",
      "missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal.  Fred was\n",
      "close behind her and his turn came before hers.  He gave a stroke, his\n",
      "ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.  No one was\n",
      "very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\n",
      "toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm through!  Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\n",
      "the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You pushed it.  I saw you.  It's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I didn't move it.  It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\n",
      "allowed.  So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\n",

      "colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\n",
      "with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out\n",
      "with much exultation.  She went off to get her ball, and was a long\n",
      "time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and\n",
      "quiet, and waited her turn patiently.  It took several strokes to\n",
      "regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side\n",
      "had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but one and lay near the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"By George, it's all up with us!  Goodbye, Kate.  Miss Jo owes me one,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo,\n",
      "with a look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\"\n",
      "she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a\n",
      "clever stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\n",
      "over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer\n",
      "to whisper to his friend, \"Good for you, Jo!  He did cheat, I saw him.\n",
      "We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again, take my word for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\n",
      "certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I\n",
      "got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now,\n",
      "so I hope he'll keep out of my way,\" returned Jo, biting her lips as\n",

      "Sallie, and I spread the table?  Who can make good coffee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo can,\" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.  So Jo, feeling that\n",
      "her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\n",
      "the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\n",
      "made a fire and got water from a spring near by.  Miss Kate sketched\n",
      "and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\n",
      "to serve as plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an\n",
      "inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with\n",
      "green leaves.  Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone\n",
      "settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and\n",
      "exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for\n",
      "everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter\n",
      "startled a venerable horse who fed near by.  There was a pleasing\n",
      "inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and\n",
      "plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the\n",
      "refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down\n",
      "from the tree to see what was going on.  Three white-headed children\n",
      "peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the\n",
      "other side of the river with all his might and main.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's salt here,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary\n",
      "little ones who had gone to a creamy death.  \"How dare you remind me of\n",
      "that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added\n",
      "Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run\n",
      "short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.\n",
      "This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything.  It's you and\n",
      "Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged to you.  What\n",
      "shall we do when we can't eat anymore?\" asked Laurie, feeling that his\n",
      "trump card had been played when lunch was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have games till it's cooler.  I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss\n",

      "you ought to stay with her more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you company too?  I thought she'd suit Brooke, but he keeps\n",
      "talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\n",
      "glass of hers.  I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for\n",
      "you can't do it, Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and\n",
      "the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing\n",
      "room to play Rig-marole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\n",
      "he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\n",
      "the next takes it up and does the same.  It's very funny when well\n",
      "done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh\n",
      "over.  Please start it, Mr. Brooke,\" said Kate, with a commanding air,\n",
      "which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any\n",
      "other gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\n",
      "obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\n",
      "for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long\n",
      "while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till\n",
      "he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to\n",
      "anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he\n",
      "was very fond.  The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,\n",
      "for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new\n",
      "master, though he was freakish and wild.  Every day, when he gave his\n",
      "lessons to this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the\n",
      "city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful\n",
      "face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.  One\n",
      "day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a\n",
      "ruinous castle the lovely face.  He was delighted, inquired who lived\n",
      "in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were\n",
      "kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their\n",
      "liberty.  The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he\n",
      "was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and\n",
      "longing to see it out in the sunshine.  At last he resolved to get into\n",
      "the castle and ask how he could help them.  He went and knocked.  The\n",
      "great door flew open, and he beheld...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\n",
      "last!  At last!'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and\n",
      "admired the style.  \"'Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her\n",
      "feet in an ecstasy of joy.  'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of\n",
      "marble fairness.  'Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore\n",
      "the knight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain\n",
      "here till my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the\n",
      "mauve salon.  Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and\n",
      "return victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away,\n",
      "and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when\n",
      "he received...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\n",
      "black gown fired at him,\" said Ned.  \"Instantly, Sir What's-his-name\n",
      "recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\n",
      "join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door\n",
      "locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when\n",
      "the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet\n",
      "below.  Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came\n",
      "to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads\n",
      "together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling\n",
      "exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a\n",
      "pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as\n",
      "your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss\n",
      "March.  At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took\n",
      "his breath away and chilled his blood...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in\n",
      "its wasted hand,\" went on Meg.  \"It beckoned, gliding noiselessly\n",
      "before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.  Shadowy\n",
      "effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the\n",
      "lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face\n",
      "toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil.\n",
      "They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.  He\n",
      "sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved\n",
      "threateningly before him a...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Snuffbox,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\n",
      "audience.  \"'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and\n",
      "sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.  'Ha! Ha!'\n",
      "laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the\n",
      "princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\n",
      "victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\n",
      "knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all\n",
      "rose and began to...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dance a hornpipe,\" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, \"and, as they\n",
      "danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail.\n",
      "'Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard alee, and man\n",
      "the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight,\n",
      "with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my\n",
      "hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous fight began.  Of course\n",
      "the British beat—they always do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, they don't!\" cried Jo, aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\n",
      "schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers\n",
      "ran blood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosun's\n",
      "mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if\n",
      "he doesn't confess his sins double quick,' said the British captain.\n",
      "The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,\n",
      "while the jolly tars cheered like mad.  But the sly dog dived, came up\n",
      "under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail\n",
      "set, 'To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea' where...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, gracious!  What shall I say?\" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\n",
      "rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases\n",
      "and facts out of one of his favorite books. \"Well, they went to the\n",
      "bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\n",
      "finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\n",
      "hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was\n",
      "curious.  By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\n",
      "you a box of pearls if you can take it up,' for she wanted to restore\n",
      "the poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.  So\n",
      "the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to\n",
      "find no pearls.  He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\n",
      "by a...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\n",
      "Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out.  \"The little girl was sorry for\n",
      "them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them.  'Your\n",
      "geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the old woman.  So she\n",
      "asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\n",
      "and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Cabbages!'\" continued Laurie promptly.  \"'Just the thing,' said the\n",
      "girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\n",
      "the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\n",
      "rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\n",
      "heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it.  The\n",
      "knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\n",
      "learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and\n",
      "married, but one.  He was in a great state of mind at that, and\n",
      "mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to\n",
      "the castle to see which was left.  Peeping over the hedge, he saw the\n",
      "queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden.  'Will you give\n",
      "me a rose?' said he.  'You must come and get it.  I can't come to you,\n",
      "it isn't proper,' said she, as sweet as honey.  He tried to climb over\n",
      "the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.  Then he tried to\n",
      "push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair.\n",
      "So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole\n",
      "through which he peeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in!  Let me in!'\n",
      "But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her\n",
      "roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in.  Whether he did or\n",
      "not, Frank will tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't.  I'm not playing, I never do,\" said Frank, dismayed at the\n",
      "sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd\n",
      "couple.  Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?\" asked\n",
      "Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in\n",
      "his buttonhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a\n",

      "\"What is it?\" said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn,\n",
      "and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question\n",
      "put by the rest.  It's great fun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's try it,\" said Jo, who liked new experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,\n",
      "and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.\n",

      "\"Try again.  Truth isn't a bad game,\" said Fred.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What is your greatest fault?\" asked Fred, by way of testing in her the\n",

      "\"A quick temper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you most wish for?\" said Laurie.\n",

      "\"Not a true answer.  You must say what you really do want most.\"\n",

      "\"Good!  Didn't you take your story out of The Sea Lion?\" said Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?\" asked\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He's a true John Bull.  Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance\n",
      "without waiting to draw.  I'll harrrow up your feelings first by asking\n",
      "if you don't think you are something of a flirt,\" said Laurie, as Jo\n",
      "nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You impertinent boy!  Of course I'm not,\" exclaimed Sallie, with an\n",

      "\n",
      "Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on,\n",
      "the three elders sat apart, talking.  Miss Kate took out her sketch\n",
      "again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you learn?  I should think you had taste and talent for it,\"\n",
      "replied Miss Kate graciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.  So did mine, but I\n",
      "proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately, and\n",
      "then she was quite willing I should go on.  Can't you do the same with\n",
      "your governess?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have none.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't go at all.  I am a governess myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed!\" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, \"Dear\n",
      "me, how dreadful!\" for her tone implied it, and something in her face\n",
      "made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, \"Young ladies in America love\n",
      "independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and\n",
      "respected for supporting themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so.  We\n",
      "have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and\n",
      "are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of\n",
      "gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,\" said\n",
      "Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and made her\n",
      "work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did the German song suit, Miss March?\" inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking\n",
      "an awkward pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!  It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever\n",
      "translated it for me.\" And Meg's downcast face brightened as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you read German?\" asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not very well.  My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on\n",
      "very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try a little now.  Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor who\n",
      "loves to teach.\"  And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with an\n",
      "inviting smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's so hard I'm afraid to try,\" said Meg, grateful, but bashful in\n",
      "the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll read a bit to encourage you.\" And Miss Kate read one of the most\n",
      "beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who said\n",
      "innocently, \"I thought it was poetry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of it is.  Try this passage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at poor\n",
      "Mary's lament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used\n",
      "to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of\n",
      "the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice.  Down the\n",
      "page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in\n",
      "the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little\n",
      "touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.  If she had seen\n",
      "the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked\n",
      "up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well indeed!\" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her\n",
      "many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little\n",
      "tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,\n",
      "\"You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader.  I advise\n",
      "you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers.  I\n",
      "must look after Grace, she is romping.\" And Miss Kate strolled away,\n",
      "adding to herself with a shrug, \"I didn't come to chaperone a\n",
      "governess, though she is young and pretty.  What odd people these\n",
      "Yankees are.  I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses\n",
      "and don't treat them as we do,\" said Meg, looking after the retreating\n",
      "figure with an annoyed expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my\n",
      "sorrow.  There's no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.\"\n",
      "And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to\n",
      "lament her hard lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad I live in it then.  I don't like my work, but I get a good\n",
      "deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain. I only\n",
      "wished I liked teaching as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil.  I shall be very\n",
      "sorry to lose him next year,\" said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in\n",
      "the turf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going to college, I suppose?\" Meg's lips asked the question, but her\n",
      "eyes added, \"And what becomes of you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he is\n",
      "off, I shall turn soldier.  I am needed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad of that!\" exclaimed Meg.  \"I should think every young man\n",
      "would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who\n",
      "stay at home,\" she added sorrowfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the\n",
      "hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all\n",
      "be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,\" said Meg heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, that sounds pleasant,\" began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful\n",
      "again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old\n",
      "horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the\n",
      "young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you love to ride?\" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting\n",
      "after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dote upon it.  My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but\n",
      "we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,\" added Amy, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me about Ellen Tree.  Is it a donkey?\" asked Grace curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we've only got\n",
      "an old sidesaddle and no horse.  Out in our garden is an apple tree\n",
      "that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some\n",
      "reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree\n",
      "whenever we like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How funny!\" laughed Grace.  \"I have a pony at home, and ride nearly\n",
      "every day in the park with Fred and Kate.  It's very nice, for my\n",
      "friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, how charming!  I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd rather\n",
      "go to Rome than the Row,\" said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what\n",
      "the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were\n",
      "saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture\n",
      "as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical\n",
      "gymnastics.  Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,\n",
      "looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, \"I'm afraid you are\n",
      "tired.  Can I do anything for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Talk to me, please.  It's dull, sitting by myself,\" answered Frank,\n",
      "who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a\n",
      "more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,\n",
      "no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her\n",
      "that she bravely resolved to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you like to talk about?\" she asked, fumbling over the cards\n",
      "and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,\" said\n",
      "Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart!  What shall I do?  I don't know anything about them, thought\n",
      "Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said,\n",
      "hoping to make him talk, \"I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you\n",
      "know all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a\n",
      "confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for\n",
      "me,\" said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her\n",
      "innocent blunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,\" she said,\n",
      "turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one\n",
      "of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to\n",
      "amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her\n",
      "sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking\n",
      "away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged\n",
      "protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless her heart!  She pities him, so she is good to him,\" said Jo,\n",
      "beaming at her from the croquet ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always said she was a little saint,\" added Meg, as if there could be\n",
      "no further doubt of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,\" said Grace to\n",
      "Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn\n",
      "cups.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,\" said\n",
      "Amy, well pleased at Beth's success.  She meant 'facinating', but as\n",
      "Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded\n",
      "well and made a good impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet\n",
      "finished the afternoon.  At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,\n",
      "wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the\n",
      "river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,\n",
      "warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,\n",
      "\n",
      "and at the lines...\n",
      "\n",
      "    We each are young, we each have a heart,\n",
      "    Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?\n",
      "\n",
      "he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed\n",
      "outright and spoiled his song.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you be so cruel to me?\" he whispered, under cover of a lively\n",
      "chorus.  \"You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day,\n",
      "and now you snub me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it,\"\n",
      "replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was\n",
      "quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and\n",
      "the talk after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her\n",
      "rather pettishly, \"There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a particle, but she's a dear,\" returned Sallie, defending her\n",
      "friend even while confessing her shortcomings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's not a stricken deer anyway,\" said Ned, trying to be witty, and\n",
      "succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with\n",
      "cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.\n",
      "As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked\n",
      "after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, \"In\n",
      "spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when\n",
      "one knows them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I quite agree with you,\" said Mr. Brooke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm\n",
      "September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too\n",
      "lazy to go and find out.  He was in one of his moods, for the day had\n",
      "been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could\n",
      "live it over again.  The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\n",
      "shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\n",
      "displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened\n",
      "the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that\n",
      "one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman\n",
      "about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\n",
      "hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\n",
      "peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up\n",
      "into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed\n",
      "dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the\n",
      "ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him\n",
      "ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw\n",
      "the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the world are those girls about now?\" thought Laurie, opening\n",
      "his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather\n",
      "peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.  Each wore a large,\n",
      "flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried\n",
      "a long staff.  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a\n",
      "portfolio.  All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little\n",
      "back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and\n",
      "river.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's cool,\" said Laurie to himself, \"to have a picnic and\n",
      "never ask me!  They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got\n",
      "the key.  Perhaps they forgot it.  I'll take it to them, and see what's\n",
      "going on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find\n",
      "one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in\n",
      "his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped\n",
      "the fence and ran after them.  Taking the shortest way to the\n",
      "boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went\n",
      "up the hill to take an observation.  A grove of pines covered one part\n",
      "of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than\n",
      "the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a landscape!\" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\n",
      "looking wide-awake and good-natured already.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in\n",
      "the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic\n",
      "wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the\n",
      "little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no\n",
      "strangers but old friends.  Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily\n",
      "with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her\n",
      "pink dress among the green.  Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick\n",
      "under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them.  Amy\n",
      "was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.\n",
      "A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he\n",
      "ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed\n",
      "very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his\n",
      "restless spirit.  He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its\n",
      "harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and\n",
      "skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the\n",
      "wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I come in, please?  Or shall I be a bother?\" he asked, advancing\n",
      "slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at\n",
      "once, \"Of course you may.  We should have asked you before, only we\n",
      "thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no objection, if you do something.  It's against the rules to be\n",
      "idle here,\" replied Meg gravely but graciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged.  I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's\n",
      "as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.  Shall I sew, read, cone,\n",
      "draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.\"  And Laurie\n",
      "sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Finish this story while I set my heel,\" said Jo, handing him the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes'm.\" was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his\n",
      "gratitude for the favor of admission into the 'Busy Bee Society'.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to\n",
      "ask a few questions as a reward of merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming\n",
      "institution is a new one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you tell him?\" asked Meg of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll laugh,\" said Amy warningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who cares?\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess he'll like it,\" added Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I shall!  I give you my word I won't laugh.  Tell away, Jo,\n",
      "and don't be afraid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea of being afraid of you!  Well, you see we used to play\n",
      "Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all\n",
      "winter and summer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know,\" said Laurie, nodding wisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who told you?\" demanded Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I did.  I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away,\n",
      "and he was rather dismal.  He did like it, so don't scold, Jo,\" said\n",
      "Beth meekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't keep a secret.  Never mind, it saves trouble now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on, please,\" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,\n",
      "looking a trifle displeased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours?  Well, we have\n",
      "tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at\n",
      "it with a will.  The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\n",
      "and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I should think so,\" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own\n",
      "idle days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring\n",
      "our work here and have nice times.  For the fun of it we bring our\n",
      "things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\n",
      "and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.  We call this hill the\n",
      "Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where\n",
      "we hope to live some time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the\n",
      "wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\n",
      "other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green\n",
      "hills that rose to meet the sky.  The sun was low, and the heavens\n",
      "glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset.  Gold and purple clouds\n",
      "lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery\n",
      "white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How beautiful that is!\" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see\n",
      "and feel beauty of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\n",
      "always splendid,\" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime—the real\n",
      "country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be\n",
      "nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\n",
      "ever go to it,\" said Beth musingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,\n",
      "by-and-by, when we are good enough,\" answered Meg with her sweetest\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.  I want to fly away at once,\n",
      "as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\"I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\n",
      "maybe never get in after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort.  I shall have to do\n",
      "a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City.  If\n",
      "I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she said\n",
      "cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \"If people\n",
      "really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will\n",
      "get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that door or any\n",
      "guards at the gate.  I always imagine it is as it is in the picture,\n",
      "where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor\n",
      "Christian as he comes up from the river.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\n",
      "come true, and we could live in them?\" said Jo, after a little pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,\"\n",
      "said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\n",
      "betrayed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd have to take your favorite one.  What is it?\" asked Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if the girls will too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will.  Now, Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle\n",
      "in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.  I'm to be a famous\n",
      "musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me.  And I'm never\n",
      "to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live\n",
      "for what I like.  That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a\n",
      "brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she\n",
      "said slowly, \"I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of\n",
      "luxurious things—nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,\n",
      "pleasant people, and heaps of money.  I am to be mistress of it, and\n",
      "manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a\n",
      "bit.  How I should enjoy it!  For I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and\n",
      "make everyone love me dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?\" asked Laurie\n",
      "slyly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I said 'pleasant people', you know,\" and Meg carefully tied up her\n",
      "shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some\n",
      "angelic little children?  You know your castle wouldn't be perfect\n",
      "without,\" said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather\n",
      "scorned romance, except in books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\"\n",
      "answered Meg petulantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't I though?  I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\n",
      "piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that\n",
      "my works should be as famous as Laurie's music.  I want to do something\n",
      "splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that\n",
      "won't be forgotten after I'm dead.  I don't know what, but I'm on the\n",
      "watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.  I think I shall\n",
      "write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my\n",
      "favorite dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take\n",
      "care of the family,\" said Beth contentedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you wish for anything else?\" asked Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.  I only wish we\n",
      "may all keep well and be together, nothing else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\n",
      "to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\n",
      "world,\" was Amy's modest desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're an ambitious set, aren't we?  Every one of us, but Beth, wants\n",
      "to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if\n",
      "any of us will ever get our wishes,\" said Laurie, chewing grass like a\n",
      "meditative calf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the\n",
      "door remains to be seen,\" observed Jo mysteriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang\n",
      "college!\" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's mine!\" and Amy waved her pencil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any,\" said Meg forlornly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you have,\" said Laurie at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In your face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense, that's of no use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,\" replied\n",
      "the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\n",
      "fancied he knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across\n",
      "the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn\n",
      "when he told the story of the knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how many of\n",
      "us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,\" said\n",
      "Jo, always ready with a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me!  How old I shall be, twenty-seven!\" exclaimed Meg, who felt\n",
      "grown up already, having just reached seventeen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy\n",
      "twenty-two.  What a venerable party!\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but\n",
      "I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure\n",
      "you'll work splendidly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is she?  By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!\" cried Laurie,\n",
      "sitting up with sudden energy.  \"I ought to be satisfied to please\n",
      "Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,\n",
      "and comes hard.  He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and\n",
      "I'd rather be shot.  I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\n",
      "rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the\n",
      "bottom when I own them.  Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if\n",
      "I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.  But\n",
      "he's set, and I've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and\n",
      "please myself, as my father did.  If there was anyone left to stay with\n",
      "the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\n",
      "execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast\n",
      "and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of\n",
      "subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\n",
      "again till you have tried your own way,\" said Jo, whose imagination was\n",
      "fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\n",
      "excited by what she called 'Teddy's Wrongs'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not right, Jo.  You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie\n",
      "mustn't take your bad advice.  You should do just what your grandfather\n",
      "wishes, my dear boy,\" said Meg in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best\n",
      "at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he\n",
      "won't be hard on you or unjust to you.  As you say, there is no one\n",
      "else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you\n",
      "left him without his permission.  Don't be dismal or fret, but do your\n",
      "duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being\n",
      "respected and loved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\n",
      "advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\n",
      "from himself after his unusual outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his\n",
      "own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\n",
      "person because he wouldn't leave her.  And how he provides now for an\n",
      "old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as\n",
      "generous and patient and good as he can be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\n",
      "looking flushed and earnest with her story.  \"It's like Grandpa to find\n",
      "out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his\n",
      "goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\n",
      "understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me\n",
      "and treating him in her beautiful friendly way.  He thought she was\n",
      "just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about\n",
      "you all in flaming style.  If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll\n",
      "do for Brooke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\n",
      "sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know I do, Miss?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can always tell by his face when he goes away.  If you have been\n",
      "good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.  If you have plagued him,\n",
      "he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\n",
      "better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I like that?  So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\n",
      "Brooke's face, do you?  I see him bow and smile as he passes your\n",
      "window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We haven't.  Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything!\n",
      "It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here\n",
      "is said in confidence, you know,\" cried Meg, much alarmed at the\n",
      "thought of what might follow from her careless speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't tell tales,\" replied Laurie, with his 'high and mighty' air,\n",
      "as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. \"Only if\n",
      "Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather\n",
      "for him to report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't be offended.  I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\n",
      "silly.  I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd\n",
      "be sorry for by-and-by.  You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were\n",
      "our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\"\n",
      "And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\n",
      "and said frankly, \"I'm the one to be forgiven.  I'm cross and have been\n",
      "out of sorts all day.  I like to have you tell me my faults and be\n",
      "sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes.  I thank you all the\n",
      "same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\n",
      "as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\n",
      "down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\n",
      "fit person to belong to the 'Busy Bee Society'.  In the midst of an\n",
      "animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\n",
      "amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound\n",
      "of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea 'to draw', and they\n",
      "would just have time to get home to supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I come again?\" asked Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer\n",
      "are told to do,\" said Meg, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do.\n",
      "There's a demand for socks just now,\" added Jo, waving hers like a big\n",
      "blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,\n",
      "standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,\n",
      "whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old\n",
      "man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts\n",
      "of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of\n",
      "the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\n",
      "sacrifice cheerfully, \"I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear\n",
      "old gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\n",
      "chilly, and the afternoons were short.  For two or three hours the sun\n",
      "lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\n",
      "writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\n",
      "while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\n",
      "by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\n",
      "his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\n",
      "last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and\n",
      "threw down her pen, exclaiming...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, I've done my best!  If this won't suit I shall have to wait\n",
      "till I can do better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\n",
      "making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\n",
      "which looked like little balloons.  Then she tied it up with a smart\n",
      "red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful\n",
      "expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been.  Jo's\n",
      "desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall.  In it\n",
      "she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,\n",
      "who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a\n",
      "circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the\n",
      "leaves.  From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and\n",
      "putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her\n",
      "friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.\n",
      "\n",
      "She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to\n",
      "the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\n",
      "herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\n",
      "Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\n",
      "away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements\n",
      "decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till\n",
      "she reached a certain number in a certain busy street.  Having found\n",
      "the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up\n",
      "the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly\n",
      "dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came.  This\n",
      "maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\n",
      "black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\n",
      "opposite.  On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\n",
      "pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\n",
      "she were going to have all her teeth out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\n",
      "and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\n",
      "opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\n",
      "gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\n",
      "in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, \"It's like\n",
      "her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need someone to\n",
      "help her home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the\n",
      "general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\n",
      "ordeal of some sort.  When she saw the young gentleman she looked\n",
      "anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod.  But he followed,\n",
      "asking with an air of sympathy, \"Did you have a bad time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not very.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You got through quickly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, thank goodness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you go alone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't want anyone to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw.  How many did you have out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to\n",
      "laugh as if mightily amused at something.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better,\n",

      "like Mr. King's son.  He had plenty of money, but didn't know how to\n",
      "spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his\n",

      "\n",
      "Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she\n",

      "as if at her warnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?\" he asked\n",

      "tell me yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any,\" began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that\n",
      "she had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know you have—you can't hide anything, so up and 'fess, or I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Is your secret a nice one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, isn't it!  All about people you know, and such fun!  You ought to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I never tease.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you do.  You get everything you want out of people.  I don't know\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's to give his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!\" cried\n",
      "Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight\n",
      "of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,\n",
      "for they were out of the city now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush!  It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't rest till\n",

      "else to be disappointed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It won't fail.  Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare\n",

      "fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our authoress?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a\n",
      "friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's your secret?  Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not to, so I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and\n",
      "twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you\n",
      "where it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a\n",
      "comical change.  She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both\n",
      "surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, \"How do you\n",
      "know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Saw it.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, isn't that romantic?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't you like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I don't.  It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed.  My\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are not to tell anyone.  Mind that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't promise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was understood, and I trusted you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and wish you\n",
      "hadn't told me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd be pleased.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to see anyone try it,\" cried Jo fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So should I!\" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind\n",
      "since you told me that,\" said Jo rather ungratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,\" suggested\n",
      "Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and\n",
      "finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat\n",
      "and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached\n",
      "the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his\n",
      "treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright\n",
      "eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air,\n",
      "and not lose my breath.  It was capital, but see what a guy it's made\n",
      "me.  Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,\" said Jo,\n",
      "dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with\n",
      "crimson leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled\n",
      "up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.\n",
      "But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking\n",
      "particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been\n",
      "making calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the world are you doing here?\" she asked, regarding her\n",
      "disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Getting leaves,\" meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had\n",
      "just swept up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And hairpins,\" added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.\n",
      "\"They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have been running, Jo.  How could you?  When will you stop such\n",
      "romping ways?\" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and\n",
      "smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch.  Don't try to\n",
      "make me grow up before my time, Meg.  It's hard enough to have you\n",
      "change all of a sudden.  Let me be a little girl as long as I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her\n",
      "lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a\n",
      "woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must\n",
      "surely come some time and now seemed very near.  He saw the trouble in\n",
      "her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where\n",
      "have you been calling, all so fine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\n",
      "Moffat's wedding.  It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend\n",
      "the winter in Paris.  Just think how delightful that must be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you envy her, Meg?\" said Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of it!\" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Meg, looking surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\n",
      "poor man,\" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\n",
      "mind what she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall never 'go and marry' anyone,\" observed Meg, walking on with\n",
      "great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping\n",
      "stones, and 'behaving like children', as Meg said to herself, though\n",
      "she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best\n",
      "dress on.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite\n",
      "bewildered.  She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to\n",
      "Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a\n",
      "woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in\n",
      "a very mysterious manner.  Laurie and she were always making signs to\n",
      "one another, and talking about 'Spread Eagles' till the girls declared\n",
      "they had both lost their wits.  On the second Saturday after Jo got out\n",
      "of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by\n",
      "the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally\n",
      "capturing her in Amy's bower.  What went on there, Meg could not see,\n",
      "but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices\n",
      "and a great flapping of newspapers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we do with that girl?  She never will behave like a young\n",
      "lady,\" sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope she won't.  She is so funny and dear as she is,\" said Beth, who\n",
      "had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets\n",
      "with anyone but her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,\" added Amy,\n",
      "who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a\n",
      "very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually\n",
      "elegant and ladylike.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected\n",
      "to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you anything interesting there?\" asked Meg, with condescension.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,\" returned Jo,\n",
      "carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better read it aloud.  That will amuse us and keep you out of\n",
      "mischief,\" said Amy in her most grown-up tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the name?\" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind\n",
      "the sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Rival Painters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That sounds well.  Read it,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a loud \"Hem!\" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast.  The\n",
      "girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat\n",
      "pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. \"I like that about\n",
      "the splendid picture,\" was Amy's approving remark, as Jo paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I prefer the lovering part.  Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite\n",
      "names, isn't that queer?\" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering\n",
      "part was tragical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who wrote it?\" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed\n",
      "countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement\n",
      "replied in a loud voice, \"Your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You?\" cried Meg, dropping her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very good,\" said Amy critically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew it!  I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!\"  and Beth ran to hug\n",
      "her sister and exult over this splendid success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!  How Meg wouldn't\n",
      "believe it till she saw the words.  \"Miss Josephine March,\" actually\n",
      "printed in the paper.  How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts\n",
      "of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately\n",
      "couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead.  How Beth\n",
      "got excited, and skipped and sang with joy.  How Hannah came in to\n",
      "exclaim, \"Sakes alive, well I never!\" in great astonishment at 'that\n",
      "Jo's doin's'.  How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.  How Jo\n",
      "laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a\n",
      "peacock and done with it, and how the 'Spread Eagle' might be said to\n",
      "flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper\n",
      "passed from hand to hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell us about it.\"  \"When did it come?\" \"How much did you get for it?\"\n",
      "\"What will Father say?\" \"Won't Laurie laugh?\" cried the family, all in\n",
      "one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate\n",
      "people made a jubilee of every little household joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,\" said Jo,\n",
      "wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did\n",
      "over her 'Rival Painters'.  Having told how she disposed of her tales,\n",
      "Jo added, \"And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them\n",
      "both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and\n",
      "noticed the stories.  It was good practice, he said, and when the\n",
      "beginners improved, anyone would pay.  So I let him have the two\n",
      "stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it\n",
      "and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.  And he said it was good, and\n",
      "I shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I am\n",
      "so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the\n",
      "girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she\n",
      "bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be\n",
      "independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest\n",
      "wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that\n",
      "happy end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,\" said\n",

      "\"That's the reason I was born in it,\" observed Jo pensively, quite\n",
      "unconscious of the blot on her nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a\n",

      "even November.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,\"\n",
      "said Meg, who was out of sorts.  \"We go grubbing along day after day,\n",

      "for you as I do for my heroines!  You're pretty enough and good enough\n",
      "already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a fortune\n",
      "unexpectedly.  Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who\n",

      "\n",

      "and see if we don't,\" said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as\n",
      "Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt,\n",
      "though I'm grateful for your good intentions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.  Jo groaned and\n",
      "leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy\n",
      "spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window,\n",
      "said, smiling, \"Two pleasant things are going to happen right away.\n",
      "Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the\n",
      "garden as if he had something nice to tell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, \"Any letter from\n",
      "Father, girls?\" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, \"Won't some of\n",
      "you come for a drive?  I've been working away at mathematics till my\n",
      "head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.\n",
      "It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going to take Brooke\n",
      "home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out.  Come, Jo, you and\n",
      "Beth will go, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course we will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged, but I'm busy.\"  And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for\n",
      "she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not\n",
      "to drive too often with the young gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We three will be ready in a minute,\" cried Amy, running away to wash\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?\" asked Laurie, leaning over\n",
      "Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind, dear.\n",
      "It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been.  Father is as\n",
      "regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a\n",
      "letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,\" she said, handling it\n",
      "as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the word 'telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it\n",
      "contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little\n",
      "paper had sent a bullet to her heart.  Laurie dashed downstairs for\n",
      "water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a\n",
      "frightened voice...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Mrs. March:\n",
      "    Your husband is very ill.  Come at once.\n",

      "How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the\n",
      "day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to\n",
      "change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the\n",
      "happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and\n",
      "stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never\n",
      "forgot, \"I shall go at once, but it may be too late.  Oh, children,\n",
      "children, help me to bear it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the\n",
      "room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,\n",
      "and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.  Poor Hannah was the\n",
      "first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a\n",
      "good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Lord keep the dear man!  I won't waste no time a-cryin', but git\n",
      "your things ready right away, mum,\" she said heartily, as she wiped her\n",
      "face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her\n",
      "own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's right, there's no time for tears now.  Be calm, girls, and let\n",
      "me think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking\n",
      "pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's Laurie?\" she asked presently, when she had collected her\n",
      "thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, ma'am.  Oh, let me do something!\" cried the boy, hurrying from\n",
      "the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow\n",
      "was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send a telegram saying I will come at once.  The next train goes early\n",
      "in the morning.  I'll take that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else?  The horses are ready.  I can go anywhere, do anything,\" he\n",

      "\n",
      "Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew\n",
      "the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad\n",
      "journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to\n",
      "add a little to the sum for her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace.\n",
      "There is no need of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later\n",

      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way\n",
      "get these things.  I'll put them down, they'll be needed and I must go\n",
      "prepared for nursing.  Hospital stores are not always good.  Beth, go\n",
      "and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine.  I'm not too\n",
      "proud to beg for Father.  He shall have the best of everything.  Amy,\n",

      "\n",
      "Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the\n",
      "poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little\n",
      "while, and let them work.  Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust\n",
      "of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if\n",
      "the paper had been an evil spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the\n",
      "kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest\n",
      "promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which\n",
      "comforted her very much.  There was nothing he didn't offer, from his\n",
      "own dressing gown to himself as escort.  But the last was impossible.\n",
      "Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long\n",
      "journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,\n",
      "for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy\n",
      "eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be\n",
      "back directly.  No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran\n",
      "through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea\n",
      "in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,\" he said, in the kind,\n",
      "quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit.  \"I\n",
      "came to offer myself as escort to your mother.  Mr. Laurence has\n",
      "commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction\n",
      "to be of service to her there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg\n",
      "put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke\n",
      "would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling\n",
      "one of time and comfort which he was about to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you all are!  Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it will be\n",
      "such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.  Thank\n",
      "you very, very much!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the\n",
      "brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and\n",
      "lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from\n",
      "Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what\n",
      "she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd\n",
      "for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come\n",
      "of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time.  Mrs.\n",
      "March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on\n",
      "with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo\n",
      "would have understood if she had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The short afternoon wore away.  All other errands were done, and Meg\n",
      "and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy\n",
      "got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a 'slap\n",
      "and a bang', but still Jo did not come.  They began to get anxious, and\n",
      "Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take\n",
      "into her head.  He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a\n",
      "very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun\n",
      "and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as\n",
      "much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a\n",
      "little choke in her voice, \"That's my contribution toward making Father\n",
      "comfortable and bringing him home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, where did you get it?  Twenty-five dollars!  Jo, I hope you\n",
      "haven't done anything rash?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's mine honestly.  I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it.  I earned\n",
      "it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for\n",
      "all her abundant hair was cut short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your hair!  Your beautiful hair!\"  \"Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one\n",
      "beauty.\"  \"My dear girl, there was no need of this.\"  \"She doesn't look\n",
      "like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo\n",
      "assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,\n",
      "and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked\n",
      "it, \"It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth.  It\n",
      "will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig.  It will\n",
      "do my brains good to have that mop taken off.  My head feels\n",
      "deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a\n",
      "curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.\n",
      "I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me all about it, Jo.  I am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame\n",
      "you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call\n",
      "it, to your love.  But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid\n",
      "you will regret it one of these days,\" said Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I won't!\" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her\n",
      "prank was not entirely condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What made you do it?\" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of\n",
      "cutting off her head as her pretty hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I was wild to do something for Father,\" replied Jo, as they\n",
      "gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the\n",
      "midst of trouble.  \"I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew\n",
      "Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence.\n",
      "Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some\n",
      "clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,\n",
      "if I sold the nose off my face to get it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got\n",
      "the simplest with your own hard earnings,\" said Mrs. March with a look\n",
      "that warmed Jo's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went\n",
      "along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to\n",
      "dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.  In a barber's\n",
      "window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,\n",
      "not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.  It came to me all of a sudden\n",
      "that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to\n",
      "think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give\n",
      "for mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how you dared to do it,\" said Beth in a tone of awe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his\n",
      "hair.  He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls\n",
      "bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.  He said he didn't\n",
      "care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid\n",
      "much for it in the first place.  The work put into it made it dear, and\n",
      "so on.  It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right\n",
      "away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to\n",
      "do a thing, I hate to give it up.  So I begged him to take it, and told\n",
      "him why I was in such a hurry.  It was silly, I dare say, but it\n",
      "changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my\n",
      "topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, 'Take it,\n",
      "Thomas, and oblige the young lady.  I'd do as much for our Jimmy any\n",
      "day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who was Jimmy?\" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they\n",
      "went along.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her son, she said, who was in the army.  How friendly such things make\n",
      "strangers feel, don't they?  She talked away all the time the man\n",
      "clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?\" asked Meg, with a\n",
      "shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that\n",
      "was the end of it.  I never snivel over trifles like that. I will\n",
      "confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on\n",
      "the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost\n",
      "seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off.  The woman saw me look at it, and\n",
      "picked out a long lock for me to keep.  I'll give it to you, Marmee,\n",
      "just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don't\n",
      "think I shall ever have a mane again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short\n",
      "gray one in her desk.  She only said, \"Thank you, deary,\" but something\n",
      "in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully\n",
      "as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day\n",
      "tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to\n",
      "be nursed.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by the\n",
      "last finished job, and said, \"Come girls.\"  Beth went to the piano and\n",
      "played the father's favorite hymn.  All began bravely, but broke down\n",
      "one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to\n",
      "her music was always a sweet consoler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall need all\n",
      "the sleep we can get.  Good night, my darlings,\" said Mrs. March, as\n",
      "the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.\n",
      "\n",
      "They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear\n",
      "invalid lay in the next room.  Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite\n",
      "of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious\n",
      "thoughts she had ever known in her short life.  Jo lay motionless, and\n",
      "her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her\n",
      "exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, dear, what is it?  Are you crying about father?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My... My hair!\" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her\n",
      "emotion in the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the\n",
      "afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not sorry,\" protested Jo, with a choke.  \"I'd do it again\n",
      "tomorrow, if I could.  It's only the vain part of me that goes and\n",
      "cries in this silly way.  Don't tell anyone, it's all over now.  I\n",
      "thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my\n",
      "one beauty.  How came you to be awake?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you think of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Handsome faces—eyes particularly,\" answered Meg, smiling to herself\n",
      "in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What color do you like best?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brown, that is, sometimes.  Blue are lovely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably\n",
      "promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in\n",
      "her castle in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a\n",
      "figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,\n",
      "settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each\n",
      "unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to\n",
      "pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter.  As she lifted the\n",
      "curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from\n",
      "behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face,\n",
      "which seemed to whisper in the silence, \"Be comforted, dear soul!\n",
      "There is always light behind the clouds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter\n",
      "with an earnestness never felt before.  For now the shadow of a real\n",
      "trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and\n",
      "as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,\n",
      "and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or\n",
      "complaints from them.  Everything seemed very strange when they went\n",
      "down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.\n",
      "Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar\n",
      "face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap\n",
      "on.  The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet\n",
      "lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so\n",
      "pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it\n",
      "very hard to keep their resolution.  Meg's eyes kept filling in spite\n",
      "of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more\n",
      "than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as\n",
      "if sorrow was a new experience to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting\n",
      "for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied\n",
      "about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of\n",

      "her travelling bag...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection.\n",

      "and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly\n",
      "put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor\n",
      "children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a\n",
      "grieved look in her patient eyes.  It was late when she came back, and\n",
      "no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room.\n",
      "Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and\n",
      "there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very\n",
      "grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christopher Columbus!  What's the matter?\" cried Jo, as Beth put out\n",
      "her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Years ago, when Meg did.  Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll tell you.  Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What baby?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Hummel's.  It died in my lap before she got home,\" cried Beth\n",
      "with a sob.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor dear, how dreadful for you!  I ought to have gone,\" said Jo,\n",
      "taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big\n",
      "chair, with a remorseful face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad!  I saw in a minute it was sicker,\n",
      "but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and\n",
      "let Lotty rest.  It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little\n",
      "cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,\n",
      "and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was\n",
      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't cry, dear!  What did you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor.\n",
      "He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore\n",
      "throats.  'Scarlet fever, ma'am.  Ought to have called me before,' he\n",
      "said crossly.  Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure\n",
      "baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to\n",
      "help the others and trust to charity for his pay.  He smiled then, and\n",
      "was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned\n",
      "round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right\n",
      "away, or I'd have the fever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you won't!\" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look.\n",
      "\"Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What\n",
      "shall we do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly.  I looked in\n",
      "Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and\n",
      "queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel\n",
      "better,\" said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and\n",
      "trying to look well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mother was only at home!\" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and\n",
      "feeling that Washington was an immense way off.  She read a page,\n",
      "looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said\n",
      "gravely, \"You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and\n",
      "among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid you are going\n",
      "to have it, Beth.  I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let Amy come.  She never had it, and I should hate to give it to\n",
      "her.  Can't you and Meg have it over again?\" asked Beth, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess not.  Don't care if I do.  Serve me right, selfish pig, to let\n",
      "you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!\" muttered Jo, as she went to\n",
      "consult Hannah.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,\n",
      "assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever,\n",
      "and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt\n",
      "much relieved as they went up to call Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Hannah, when she had examined\n",
      "and questioned Beth, \"we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at\n",
      "you, dear, and see that we start right.  Then we'll send Amy off to\n",
      "Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you\n",
      "girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest,\" began Meg, looking anxious and\n",
      "self-reproachful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall, because it's my fault she is sick.  I told Mother I'd do the\n",
      "errands, and I haven't,\" said Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which will you have, Beth?  There ain't no need of but one,\" aid\n",
      "Hannah.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, please.\" And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a\n",
      "contented look, which effectually settled that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go and tell Amy,\" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather\n",
      "relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather\n",
      "have the fever than go to Aunt March.  Meg reasoned, pleaded, and\n",
      "commanded, all in vain.  Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg\n",
      "left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.  Before she came\n",
      "back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head\n",
      "in the sofa cushions.  She told her story, expecting to be consoled,\n",
      "but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,\n",
      "whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.  Presently he\n",
      "sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, \"Now be a\n",
      "sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what\n",
      "a jolly plan I've got.  You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take\n",
      "you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.\n",
      "Won't that be better than moping here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,\" began Amy, in an\n",
      "injured voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well.  You don't want to be\n",
      "sick, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with\n",
      "Beth all the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may\n",
      "escape it.  Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or\n",
      "if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly.  I\n",
      "advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke,\n",
      "miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross,\" said Amy, looking\n",
      "rather frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,\n",
      "and take you out gallivanting.  The old lady likes me, and I'll be as\n",
      "sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On my honor as a gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And come every single day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See if I don't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The identical minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And go to the theater, truly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A dozen theaters, if we may.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well—I guess I will,\" said Amy slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good girl!  Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in,\" said Laurie, with\n",
      "an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the 'giving in'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been\n",
      "wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised\n",
      "to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is the little dear?\" asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet,\n",
      "and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better.  The baby's death\n",
      "troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she\n",
      "thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,\" answered\n",
      "Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a trying world it is!\" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful\n",
      "way.  \"No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another.\n",
      "There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so\n",
      "I'm all at sea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle\n",
      "your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do\n",
      "anything?\" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of\n",
      "his friend's one beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what troubles me,\" said Meg.  \"I think we ought to tell her if\n",
      "Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave\n",
      "Father, and it will only make them anxious.  Beth won't be sick long,\n",
      "and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her,\n",
      "so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum, well, I can't say.  Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor\n",
      "has been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will.  Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,\" commanded Meg. \"We can't\n",
      "decide anything till he has been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay where you are, Jo.  I'm errand boy to this establishment,\" said\n",
      "Laurie, taking up his cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you are busy,\" began Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I've done my lessons for the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you study in vacation time?\" asked Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I follow the good example my neighbors set me,\" was Laurie's answer,\n",
      "as he swung himself out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have great hopes for my boy,\" observed Jo, watching him fly over the\n",
      "fence with an approving smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He does very well, for a boy,\" was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer,\n",
      "for the subject did not interest her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she\n",
      "would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.\n",
      "Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off\n",
      "danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want now?\" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,\n",
      "while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go away.  No boys allowed here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among\n",
      "poor folks.  Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick,\n",
      "which I've no doubt she will be, looks like it now.  Don't cry, child,\n",
      "it worries me to hear people sniff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's\n",
      "tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out,\n",
      "\"Bless my boots!\" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you hear from your mother?\" asked the old lady gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father is much better,\" replied Jo, trying to keep sober.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, is he?  Well, that won't last long, I fancy.  March never had any\n",
      "stamina,\" was the cheerful reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!  Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!\"\n",
      "squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap\n",
      "as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!  And, Jo, you'd better\n",
      "go at once.  It isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a\n",
      "rattlepated boy like...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!\" cried Polly, tumbling\n",
      "off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the 'rattlepated' boy,\n",
      "who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,\" thought Amy, as she was\n",
      "left alone with Aunt March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get along, you fright!\" screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy\n",
      "could not restrain a sniff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and\n",
      "the doctor suspected.  The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.\n",
      "Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own\n",
      "way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the\n",
      "excellent nurse.  Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,\n",
      "and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote\n",
      "letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness.  She could not\n",
      "think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind\n",
      "Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of 'Mrs. March bein' told, and worried\n",
      "just for sech a trifle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was\n",
      "very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could\n",
      "control herself.  But there came a time when during the fever fits she\n",
      "began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if\n",
      "on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen\n",
      "that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar\n",
      "faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called\n",
      "imploringly for her mother.  Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be\n",
      "allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she 'would think of\n",
      "it, though there was no danger yet'.  A letter from Washington added to\n",
      "their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of\n",
      "coming home for a long while.\n",
      "\n",
      "How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how\n",
      "heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while\n",
      "the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that\n",
      "Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how\n",
      "rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could\n",
      "buy—in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of\n",
      "life.  Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\n",
      "suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice\n",
      "sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\n",
      "Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\n",
      "hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to\n",
      "live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple\n",
      "virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more\n",
      "than talent, wealth, or beauty.  And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly\n",
      "to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no\n",
      "service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful\n",
      "grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.\n",
      "Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked\n",
      "the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young\n",
      "neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.  Everyone\n",
      "missed Beth.  The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she\n",
      "did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to\n",
      "get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and\n",
      "good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find\n",
      "how many friends shy little Beth had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in\n",
      "her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.  She longed for\n",
      "her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,\n",
      "and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.  She sent\n",
      "loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write\n",
      "soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that\n",
      "Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these\n",
      "intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing\n",
      "to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy\n",
      "sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,\n",
      "Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to\n",
      "send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter\n",
      "wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its\n",
      "death.  When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held\n",
      "the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down,\n",
      "saying, in a low voice to Hannah, \"If Mrs. March can leave her husband\n",
      "she'd better be sent for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg\n",
      "dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs\n",
      "at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a\n",
      "minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on\n",
      "her things, rushed out into the storm.  She was soon back, and while\n",
      "noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying\n",
      "that Mr. March was mending again.  Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy\n",
      "weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of\n",
      "misery that Laurie asked quickly, \"What is it?  Is Beth worse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've sent for Mother,\" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a\n",
      "tragic expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good for you, Jo!  Did you do it on your own responsibility?\" asked\n",
      "Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious\n",
      "boots, seeing how her hands shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  The doctor told us to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?\" cried Laurie, with a startled face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is.  She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the\n",
      "flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She\n",
      "doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it.\n",
      "Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find\n",
      "Him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her\n",
      "hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie\n",
      "took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his\n",
      "throat, \"I'm here.  Hold on to me, Jo, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not speak, but she did 'hold on', and the warm grasp of the\n",
      "friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her\n",
      "nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting\n",
      "words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as\n",
      "her mother used to do.  It was the best thing he could have done, far\n",
      "more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\n",
      "sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection\n",
      "administers to sorrow.  Soon she dried the tears which had relieved\n",
      "her, and looked up with a grateful face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now.  I don't feel so forlorn, and will\n",
      "try to bear it if it comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.  Soon your mother\n",
      "will be here, and then everything will be all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad Father is better.  Now she won't feel so bad about leaving\n",
      "him.  Oh, me!  It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and\n",
      "I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,\" sighed Jo, spreading her wet\n",
      "handkerchief over her knees to dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doesn't Meg pull fair?\" asked Laurie, looking indignant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and she won't\n",
      "miss her as I shall.  Beth is my conscience, and I can't give her up.\n",
      "I can't!  I can't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried\n",
      "despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a\n",
      "tear.  Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till\n",
      "he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.\n",
      "It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.\n",
      "Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, \"I don't think she\n",
      "will die.  She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe\n",
      "God will take her away yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The good and dear people always do die,\" groaned Jo, but she stopped\n",
      "crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of her own\n",
      "doubts and fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor girl, you're worn out.  It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a\n",
      "bit.  I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down\n",
      "on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from\n",
      "the table where she left it.  It must have possessed some magic, for\n",
      "the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and\n",
      "when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a\n",
      "smile, and said bravely, \"I drink— Health to my Beth!  You are a good\n",
      "doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend.  How can I ever pay you?\"\n",
      "she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done\n",
      "her troubled mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you something that\n",
      "will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,\" said\n",
      "Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come\n",
      "at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will be all right.\n",
      "Aren't you glad I did it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for\n",
      "he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or\n",
      "harming Beth.  Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the\n",
      "moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms\n",
      "round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, \"Oh, Laurie!  Oh,\n",
      "Mother!  I am so glad!\"  She did not weep again, but laughed\n",
      "hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a\n",
      "little bewildered by the sudden news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.\n",
      "He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering,\n",
      "followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at\n",
      "once.  Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying\n",
      "breathlessly, \"Oh, don't!  I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but\n",
      "you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't\n",
      "help flying at you.  Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine\n",
      "again, it makes me act so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind,\" laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.  \"Why, you see I\n",
      "got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.  We thought Hannah was overdoing the\n",
      "authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive\n",
      "us if Beth...  Well, if anything happened, you know.  So I got grandpa\n",
      "to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the\n",
      "office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my\n",
      "head off when I proposed a telegram.  I never can bear to be 'lorded\n",
      "over', so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I\n",
      "know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and\n",
      "you've only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till\n",
      "that blessed lady gets here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie, you're an angel!  How shall I ever thank you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fly at me again.  I rather liked it,\" said Laurie, looking\n",
      "mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you.  I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't\n",
      "tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless\n",
      "you, Teddy, bless you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she\n",
      "vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a\n",
      "dresser and told the assembled cats that she was \"happy, oh, so happy!\"\n",
      "while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do\n",
      "hope Mrs. March is coming right away,\" said Hannah, with an air of\n",
      "relief, when Jo told the good news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set\n",
      "the sickroom in order, and Hannah \"knocked up a couple of pies in case\n",
      "of company unexpected\".  A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through\n",
      "the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet\n",
      "rooms.  Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.  Beth's bird\n",
      "began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's\n",
      "bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,\n",
      "and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as\n",
      "they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, \"Mother's coming,\n",
      "dear! Mother's coming!\"  Every one rejoiced but Beth.  She lay in that\n",
      "heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It\n",
      "was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once\n",
      "busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and\n",
      "the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the\n",
      "pillow.  All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,\n",
      "\"Water!\" with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word.  All\n",
      "day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and\n",
      "trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind\n",
      "raged, and the hours dragged slowly by.  But night came at last, and\n",
      "every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side\n",
      "of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour\n",
      "brought help nearer.  The doctor had been in to say that some change,\n",
      "for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which\n",
      "time he would return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell\n",
      "fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling\n",
      "that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's countenance\n",
      "as she entered.  Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring\n",
      "into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes\n",
      "beautifully soft and clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they\n",
      "kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes\n",
      "to us in hours like those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,\" whispered Meg\n",
      "earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,\"\n",
      "answered Jo, with equal fervor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had no heart, it aches so,\" sighed Meg, after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get\n",
      "through it,\" added her sister despondently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching\n",
      "Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was\n",
      "still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep\n",
      "hush.  Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale\n",
      "shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed.  An hour went by, and\n",
      "nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.\n",
      "Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the\n",
      "storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at\n",
      "Washington, haunted the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary\n",
      "the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the\n",
      "bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy\n",
      "chair with her face hidden.  A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as\n",
      "she thought, \"Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great\n",
      "change seemed to have taken place.  The fever flush and the look of\n",
      "pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful\n",
      "in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.\n",
      "Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp\n",
      "forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, \"Good-by, my\n",
      "Beth.  Good-by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to\n",
      "the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and\n",
      "then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,\n",
      "exclaiming, under her breath, \"The fever's turned, she's sleepin'\n",
      "nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy.  Praise be given!  Oh,\n",
      "my goodness me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to\n",
      "confirm it.  He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite\n",
      "heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, \"Yes,\n",
      "my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time.  Keep\n",
      "the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark\n",
      "hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with\n",
      "hearts too full for words.  When they went back to be kissed and\n",
      "cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do,\n",
      "with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and\n",
      "breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mother would only come now!\" said Jo, as the winter night began to\n",
      "wane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See,\" said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, \"I thought\n",
      "this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand tomorrow if she—went\n",
      "away from us.  But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put\n",
      "it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she\n",
      "sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed\n",
      "so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out\n",
      "in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks like a fairy world,\" said Meg, smiling to herself, as she\n",
      "stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hark!\" cried Jo, starting to her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,\n",
      "and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, \"Girls, she's come!\n",
      "She's come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at\n",
      "Aunt March's.  She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her\n",
      "life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.  Aunt March\n",
      "never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be\n",
      "kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt\n",
      "March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,\n",
      "though she didn't think it proper to confess it.  She really did her\n",
      "best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old\n",
      "people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can\n",
      "sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at\n",
      "home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and\n",
      "receiving friendship in the sweetest way.  But Aunt March had not this\n",
      "gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim\n",
      "ways, and long, prosy talks.  Finding the child more docile and amiable\n",
      "than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,\n",
      "as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.  So\n",
      "she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught\n",
      "sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made\n",
      "her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned\n",
      "spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone.  Then\n",
      "she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was.  Not a speck\n",
      "escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much\n",
      "carving, which was never dusted to suit.  Then Polly had to be fed, the\n",
      "lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or\n",
      "deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big\n",
      "chair.  After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was\n",
      "a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.  Then she was allowed one\n",
      "hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to\n",
      "go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.\n",
      "After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady\n",
      "slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the\n",
      "first page.  Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with\n",
      "outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed\n",
      "to amuse herself as she liked till teatime.  The evenings were the\n",
      "worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her\n",
      "youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go\n",
      "to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep\n",
      "before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that\n",
      "she never could have got through that dreadful time.  The parrot alone\n",
      "was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not\n",
      "admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.\n",
      "He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk\n",
      "to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by\n",
      "pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and\n",
      "behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.  Then she could\n",
      "not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her\n",
      "when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in\n",
      "the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted\n",
      "something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day.  The cook was\n",
      "bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who\n",
      "ever took any notice of the young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with 'Madame', as she called her\n",
      "mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,\n",
      "who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but\n",
      "Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that\n",
      "she was never asked to change her religion.  She took a fancy to\n",
      "Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in\n",
      "France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces.  She\n",
      "also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious\n",
      "and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient\n",
      "chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.  Amy's chief delight was\n",
      "an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and\n",
      "secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some\n",
      "precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and\n",
      "arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel\n",
      "cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had\n",
      "adorned a belle forty years ago.  There was the garnet set which Aunt\n",
      "March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her\n",
      "wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the\n",
      "queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made\n",
      "of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn,\n",
      "Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had\n",
      "played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring,\n",
      "too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most\n",
      "precious jewel of them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\" asked Esther,\n",
      "who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm\n",
      "fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.  I should choose this if I\n",
      "might,\" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold\n",
      "and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.  Ah, no!  To me it is a\n",
      "rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,\" said Esther,\n",
      "eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads\n",
      "hanging over your glass?\" asked Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly, yes, to pray with.  It would be pleasing to the saints if one\n",
      "used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and\n",
      "always come down looking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as\n",
      "that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to\n",
      "meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before\n",
      "Madame.  She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much\n",
      "trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it be right for me to do so too?\" asked Amy, who in her\n",
      "loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was\n",
      "apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind\n",
      "her of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the\n",
      "little dressing room for you if you like it.  Say nothing to Madame,\n",
      "but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good\n",
      "thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an\n",
      "affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.\n",
      "Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next\n",
      "her room, hoping it would do her good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March\n",
      "dies,\" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the\n",
      "jewel cases one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To you and your sisters.  I know it, Madame confides in me. I\n",
      "witnessed her will, and it is to be so,\" whispered Esther smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice!  But I wish she'd let us have them now. Procrastination is\n",
      "not agreeable,\" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The\n",
      "first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,\n",
      "and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you\n",
      "when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming\n",
      "manners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?  Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely\n",
      "ring!  It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.  I do like Aunt\n",
      "March after all.\" And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face\n",
      "and a firm resolve to earn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady\n",
      "complacently admired the success of her training.  Esther fitted up the\n",
      "closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a\n",
      "picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.  She thought it was of no\n",
      "great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that\n",
      "Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.  It was, however, a\n",
      "very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and\n",
      "Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet\n",
      "face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were\n",
      "busy at her heart.  On the table she laid her little testament and\n",
      "hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought\n",
      "her, and came every day to 'sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and\n",
      "praying the dear God to preserve her sister.  Esther had given her a\n",
      "rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did\n",
      "not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone\n",
      "outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\n",
      "by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\n",
      "Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children.\n",
      "She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having\n",
      "been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in\n",
      "it confidingly.  But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\n",
      "seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and\n",
      "be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.\n",
      "In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her\n",
      "will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her\n",
      "possessions might be justly and generously divided.  It cost her a pang\n",
      "even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\n",
      "as precious as the old lady's jewels.\n",
      "\n",
      "During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as\n",
      "well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal\n",
      "terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy\n",
      "felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a\n",
      "second witness.  As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse\n",
      "herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for\n",
      "company.  In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned\n",
      "costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite\n",
      "amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and\n",
      "down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her\n",
      "train about with a rustle which delighted her ears.  So busy was she on\n",
      "this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping\n",
      "in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and\n",
      "tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting\n",
      "oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat.  She\n",
      "was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as\n",
      "Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along\n",
      "in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her,\n",
      "imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh\n",
      "or exclaim, \"Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright!  Hold your tongue!\n",
      "Kiss me, dear!  Ha! Ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\n",
      "should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to\n",
      "consult you about a very serious matter,\" said Amy, when she had shown\n",
      "her splendor and driven Polly into a corner.  \"That bird is the trial\n",
      "of my life,\" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head,\n",
      "while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a\n",
      "mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to\n",
      "let him out, and found a big spider there.  I poked it out, and it ran\n",
      "under the bookcase.  Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and\n",
      "peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his\n",
      "eye, 'Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I couldn't help laughing,\n",
      "which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?\" asked Laurie,\n",
      "yawning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\n",
      "scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! Catch her! Catch\n",
      "her!' as I chased the spider.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a lie!  Oh, lor!\" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\" cried Laurie,\n",
      "shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely\n",
      "croaked, \"Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I'm ready,\" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of\n",
      "paper out of her pocket.  \"I want you to read that, please, and tell me\n",
      "if it is legal and right.  I felt I ought to do it, for life is\n",
      "uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker,\n",
      "read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\n",
      "spelling:\n",
      "\n",
      "MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all\n",
      "my earthly property—viz. to wit:—namely\n",
      "\n",
      "To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art,\n",
      "including frames.  Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets—also\n",
      "my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it),\n",
      "also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for\n",
      "her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her 'little girl'.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my\n",
      "bronze inkstand—she lost the cover—and my most precious plaster\n",
      "rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau,\n",
      "my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being\n",
      "thin when she gets well.  And I herewith also leave her my regret that\n",
      "I ever made fun of old Joanna.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay\n",
      "portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn't any\n",
      "neck.  Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction\n",
      "any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a\n",
      "looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind\n",
      "him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family,\n",
      "especially Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron\n",
      "and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave\n",
      "hoping she 'will remember me, when it you see'.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be\n",
      "satisfied and not blame the dead.  I forgive everyone, and trust we may\n",
      "all meet when the trump shall sound.  Amen.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of\n",
      "Nov.  Anni Domino 1861.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy Curtis March\n",
      "\n",
      "Witnesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to\n",
      "rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What put it into your head?  Did anyone tell you about Beth's giving\n",
      "away her things?\" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,\n",
      "with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She explained and then asked anxiously, \"What about Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you.  She felt so ill one\n",
      "day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to\n",
      "you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.  She\n",
      "was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest\n",
      "of us, and her best love to Grandpa.  She never thought of a will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a\n",
      "great tear dropped on the paper.  Amy's face was full of trouble, but\n",
      "she only said, \"Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,\n",
      "sometimes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, 'codicils', they call them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given\n",
      "round to my friends.  I forgot it, but I want it done though it will\n",
      "spoil my looks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\n",
      "amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials.  But\n",
      "when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips,\n",
      "\"Is there really any danger about Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,\n",
      "dear.\"  And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\n",
      "was very comforting.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the\n",
      "twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\n",
      "feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\n",
      "loss of her gentle little sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\n",
      "mother and daughters.  Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard\n",
      "to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,\n",
      "merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that\n",
      "Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,\n",
      "healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little\n",
      "rose and Mother's face.  Too weak to wonder at anything, she only\n",
      "smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the\n",
      "hungry longing was satisfied at last.  Then she slept again, and the\n",
      "girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand\n",
      "which clung to hers even in sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah had 'dished up' an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,\n",
      "finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg\n",
      "and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened\n",
      "to her whispered account of Father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to\n",
      "stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the\n",
      "homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had\n",
      "given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a strange yet pleasant day that was.  So brilliant and gay\n",
      "without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.  So\n",
      "quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,\n",
      "and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah\n",
      "mounted guard at the door.  With a blissful sense of burdens lifted\n",
      "off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like\n",
      "storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.  Mrs. March would\n",
      "not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to\n",
      "look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some\n",
      "recovered treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\n",
      "that Aunt March actually 'sniffed' herself, and never once said \"I told\n",
      "you so\".  Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\n",
      "thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.  She dried\n",
      "her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and\n",
      "never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily\n",
      "agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved 'like a capital little\n",
      "woman'.  Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl,\n",
      "blessed her buttons, and begged her to \"come and take a walk, dear\", in\n",
      "his most affable tone.  She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy\n",
      "the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping\n",
      "with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she\n",
      "persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her\n",
      "mother.  She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was\n",
      "stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt\n",
      "March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual\n",
      "fit of benignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till\n",
      "night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually\n",
      "roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were\n",
      "a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it\n",
      "is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in\n",
      "her mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and\n",
      "compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses.  They\n",
      "were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object\n",
      "when its purpose was explained to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,\" looking from the dusty\n",
      "rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its\n",
      "garland of evergreen.  \"It is an excellent plan to have some place\n",
      "where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us.  There are a\n",
      "good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them\n",
      "if we ask help in the right way.  I think my little girl is learning\n",
      "this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big\n",
      "closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to\n",
      "make.  The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for me to draw,\n",
      "but the baby is done better, and I love it very much.  I like to think\n",
      "He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that\n",
      "helps me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee, Mrs.\n",
      "March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.  She said\n",
      "nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she\n",
      "added gravely, \"I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it.\n",
      "Aunt gave me the ring today.  She called me to her and kissed me, and\n",
      "put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to\n",
      "keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as\n",
      "it's too big.  I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such\n",
      "ornaments, Amy,\" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,\n",
      "with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint\n",
      "guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try not to be vain,\" said Amy.  \"I don't think I like it only\n",
      "because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\n",
      "wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean Aunt March?\" asked her mother, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, to remind me not to be selfish.\"  Amy looked so earnest and\n",
      "sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened\n",
      "respectfully to the little plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties', and\n",
      "being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to\n",
      "cure it, if I can.  Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone\n",
      "loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.  People\n",
      "wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to\n",
      "have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,\n",
      "so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can.  I'm apt to forget my\n",
      "resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I\n",
      "guess I should do better.  May we try this way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your\n",
      "ring, dear, and do your best.  I think you will prosper, for the\n",
      "sincere wish to be good is half the battle.  Now I must go back to\n",
      "Beth.  Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you\n",
      "home again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the\n",
      "traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and\n",
      "finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her\n",
      "fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, deary?\" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a\n",
      "face which invited confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to tell you something, Mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About Meg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How quickly you guessed!  Yes, it's about her, and though it's a\n",
      "little thing, it fidgets me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beth is asleep.  Speak low, and tell me all about it.  That Moffat\n",
      "hasn't been here, I hope?\" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  I should have shut the door in his face if he had,\" said Jo,\n",
      "settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet.  \"Last summer Meg\n",
      "left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only one was returned.\n",
      "We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he\n",
      "liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so young and he so poor.\n",
      "Now, isn't it a dreadful state of things?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think Meg cares for him?\" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious\n",
      "look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy me!  I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!\" cried\n",
      "Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. \"In novels, the\n",
      "girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin,\n",
      "and acting like fools.  Now Meg does not do anything of the sort.  She\n",
      "eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight\n",
      "in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit\n",
      "when Teddy jokes about lovers.  I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't\n",
      "mind me as he ought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Mr. Brooke.  I call him 'John' now.  We fell into the way of doing so\n",
      "at the hospital, and he likes it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear!  I know you'll take his part.  He's been good to Father, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it\n",
      "happened.  John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so\n",
      "devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him.  He\n",
      "was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved\n",
      "her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry\n",
      "him.  He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the\n",
      "right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young\n",
      "man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent\n",
      "to Meg's engaging herself so young.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischief\n",
      "brewing.  I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I\n",
      "could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, \"Jo,\n",
      "I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet.  When\n",
      "John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her\n",
      "feelings toward him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She'll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will\n",
      "be all up with her.  She's got such a soft heart, it will melt like\n",
      "butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her.  She read the\n",
      "short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me\n",
      "when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an\n",
      "ugly name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace\n",
      "and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all!  They'll go lovering\n",
      "around the house, and we shall have to dodge.  Meg will be absorbed and\n",
      "no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry\n",
      "her off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and\n",
      "everything will be abominably uncomfortable.  Oh, dear me!  Why weren't\n",
      "we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook\n",
      "her fist at the reprehensible John.  Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked\n",
      "up with an air of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't like it, Mother?  I'm glad of it.  Let's send him about his\n",

      "we always have been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did wrong to sigh, Jo.  It is natural and right you should all go to\n",
      "homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I\n",
      "can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only\n",
      "seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for\n",
      "her.  Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in\n",
      "any way, nor be married, before twenty.  If she and John love one\n",
      "another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so.  She is\n",
      "conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly.  My\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never\n",

      "enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine\n",
      "happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is\n",
      "earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.  I am\n",
      "content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be\n",
      "rich in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a\n",
      "fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed about Meg,\n",
      "for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of\n",
      "luxury all her days.  Wouldn't it be nice?\" asked Jo, looking up with a\n",
      "brighter face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is younger than she, you know,\" began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be quite\n",
      "grown-up in his manners if he likes.  Then he's rich and generous and\n",
      "good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my plan is spoiled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether\n",
      "too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on.  Don't make\n",
      "plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends.  We\n",
      "can't meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get 'romantic\n",
      "rubbish' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and\n",
      "getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten\n",
      "it out.  I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from\n",
      "growing up.  But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more's the pity!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that about flatirons and cats?\" asked Meg, as she crept into\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Quite right, and beautifully written.  Please add that I send my love\n",

      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you call him 'John'?\" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes\n",
      "looking down into her mother's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,\"\n",
      "replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely.  Good night, Mother, dear.  It is\n",
      "so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\" was Meg's answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went\n",
      "away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \"She\n",
      "does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,\n",
      "and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important.  Meg\n",
      "observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had\n",
      "learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so\n",
      "she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask.  She was\n",
      "rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo\n",
      "assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn\n",
      "assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.\n",
      "This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as\n",
      "nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\n",
      "confinement.  Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as\n",
      "she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was\n",
      "an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\n",
      "mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\n",
      "it.  He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\n",
      "indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\n",
      "knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,\n",
      "he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.  Feeling\n",
      "indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his\n",
      "wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in\n",
      "preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change\n",
      "seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\n",
      "herself.  She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very\n",
      "quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her\n",
      "face.  To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well,\n",
      "and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She feels it in the air—love, I mean—and she's going very fast.\n",
      "She's got most of the symptoms—is twittery and cross, doesn't eat,\n",
      "lies awake, and mopes in corners.  I caught her singing that song he\n",
      "gave her, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then turned as red\n",
      "as a poppy.  Whatever shall we do?\" said Jo, looking ready for any\n",
      "measures, however violent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing but wait.  Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father's\n",
      "coming will settle everything,\" replied her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.  How odd! Teddy never seals\n",
      "mine,\" said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little\n",
      "post office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg\n",
      "made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My child, what is it?\" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo\n",
      "tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all a mistake, he didn't send it.  Oh, Jo, how could you do it?\"\n",
      "and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite\n",
      "broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!  I've done nothing!  What's she talking about?\" cried Jo,\n",
      "bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from\n",
      "her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, \"You wrote it, and\n",
      "that bad boy helped you.  How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel\n",
      "to us both?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note,\n",
      "which was written in a peculiar hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Dearest Margaret,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I\n",
      "return.  I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would\n",
      "consent if they knew that we adored one another.  Mr. Laurence will\n",
      "help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me\n",
      "happy.  I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send\n",
      "one word of hope through Laurie to,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your devoted John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, the little villain!  That's the way he meant to pay me for keeping\n",
      "my word to Mother.  I'll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over\n",
      "to beg pardon,\" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice.  But\n",
      "her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.  You have played so many\n",
      "pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On my word, Mother, I haven't!  I never saw that note before, and\n",
      "don't know anything about it, as true as I live!\" said Jo, so earnestly\n",
      "that they believed her.  \"If I had taken part in it I'd have done it\n",
      "better than this, and have written a sensible note.  I should think\n",
      "you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,\" she\n",
      "added, scornfully tossing down the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's like his writing,\" faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in\n",
      "her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?\" cried Mrs. March quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a scrape!  Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and\n",
      "be lectured.  I can't rest till I get hold of him.\" And Jo made for the\n",
      "door again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush!  Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,\n",
      "tell me the whole story,\" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg,\n",
      "yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew\n",
      "anything about it,\" began Meg, without looking up. \"I was worried at\n",
      "first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a\n",
      "few days.  I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I\n",
      "was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\n",
      "things to do.  Forgive me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now.  I\n",
      "never can look him in the face again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you say to him?\" asked Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn't\n",
      "wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.  I was very\n",

      "for a long while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,\n",
      "exclaiming, with a laugh, \"You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who\n",
      "was a pattern of prudence!  Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent\n",
      "any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,\n",
      "should take liberties with our names.  It's very kind and respectful,\n",
      "but think how dreadful for me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo\n",
      "tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.  All of a sudden she\n",
      "stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely,\n",
      "said decidedly, \"I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these\n",

      "\"Bless you, child!  Mother told me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do, Jo.  I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.  I\n",

      "once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.\n",
      "\"Now, dear, what are your own?  Do you love him enough to wait till he\n",
      "can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the\n",
      "present?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do\n",

      "\"If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\n",
      "this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire\n",
      "silence and great discretion for the future.  The instant Laurie's step\n",
      "was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\n",
      "the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\n",
      "wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and\n",
      "stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\n",
      "Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\n",
      "sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.  The sound of\n",
      "voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened\n",
      "during that interview the girls never knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such\n",
      "a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\n",
      "wise to betray the fact.  Meg received his humble apology, and was much\n",
      "comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it out of\n",
      "me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how\n",
      "out-and-out sorry I am,\" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't think\n",
      "you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\" replied Meg, trying to hide\n",
      "her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for\n",
      "a month, but you will, though, won't you?\" And Laurie folded his hands\n",
      "together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his\n",
      "irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him\n",
      "in spite of his scandalous behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her\n",
      "efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone\n",
      "for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm\n",
      "before the injured damsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and\n",
      "succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire\n",
      "disapprobation.  Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed\n",
      "no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\n",
      "the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked\n",
      "off without a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and\n",
      "when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for\n",
      "Teddy.  After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and\n",
      "armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Laurence in?\" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why not?  Is he ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\n",

      "dursn't go nigh him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Laurie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll go and see what the matter is.  I'm not afraid of either of them.\"\n",

      "Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.\n",

      "\"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!\" called out the young\n",
      "gentleman in a threatening tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo immediately knocked again.  The door flew open, and in she bounced\n",
      "before Laurie could recover from his surprise.  Seeing that he really\n",
      "was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite\n",
      "expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,\n",
      "\"Please forgive me for being so cross.  I came to make it up, and can't\n",
      "go away till I have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right.  Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,\" was the cavalier\n",

      "\"Who did it?\" demanded Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandfather.  If it had been anyone else I'd have...\" And the injured\n",
      "youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's nothing.  I often shake you, and you don't mind,\" said Jo\n",
      "soothingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pooh!  You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man to shake me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like\n",
      "a thundercloud as you do now.  Why were you treated so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd\n",
      "promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\n",
      "truth.  I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without\n",
      "bringing Meg in.  As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the\n",
      "scolding till the old gentleman collared me.  Then I bolted, for fear I\n",
      "should forget myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and make up.  I'll\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hanged if I do!  I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by\n",
      "everyone, just for a bit of a frolic.  I was sorry about Meg, and\n",
      "begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the\n",
      "wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He didn't know that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby.  It's no use,\n",
      "Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't\n",
      "need anyone's apron string to hold on by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What pepper pots you are!\" sighed Jo.  \"How do you mean to settle this\n",
      "affair?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell\n",
      "him what the fuss's about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you!  He won't do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't go down till he does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Teddy, be sensible.  Let it pass, and I'll explain what I can.\n",
      "You can't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to stay here long, anyway.  I'll slip off and take a\n",
      "journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come round fast\n",
      "enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't preach.  I'll go to Washington and see Brooke.  It's gay there,\n",
      "and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What fun you'd have!  I wish I could run off too,\" said Jo, forgetting\n",
      "her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, then!  Why not?  You go and surprise your father, and I'll\n",
      "stir up old Brooke.  It would be a glorious joke.  Let's do it, Jo.\n",
      "We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once.\n",
      "I've got money enough.  It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to\n",
      "your father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was,\n",
      "it just suited her.  She was tired of care and confinement, longed for\n",
      "change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel\n",
      "charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun.  Her eyes kindled as\n",
      "they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house\n",
      "opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time, but\n",
      "as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don't tempt\n",
      "me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the fun of it,\" began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him\n",
      "and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue!\" cried Jo, covering her ears.  \"'Prunes and prisms'\n",
      "are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it.  I came here to\n",
      "moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had\n",
      "more spirit,\" began Laurie insinuatingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bad boy, be quiet!  Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go\n",
      "making me add to mine.  If I get your grandpa to apologize for the\n",
      "shaking, will you give up running away?\" asked Jo seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but you won't do it,\" answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but\n",
      "felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,\" muttered Jo, as she\n",
      "walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head\n",
      "propped up on both hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in!\" and Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as\n",
      "Jo tapped at his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only me, Sir, come to return a book,\" she said blandly, as she\n",
      "entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Want any more?\" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but\n",
      "trying not to show it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, please.  I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second\n",
      "volume,\" returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second\n",
      "dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the\n",
      "shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed.  Jo skipped up, and\n",
      "sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\n",
      "really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her\n",
      "visit.  Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in\n",
      "her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\n",
      "round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward\n",
      "on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has that boy been about?  Don't try to shield him.  I know he has\n",
      "been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home.  I can't get a\n",
      "word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he\n",
      "bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word\n",
      "to anyone,\" began Jo reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That won't do.  He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you\n",
      "softhearted girls.  If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg\n",
      "pardon, and be punished.  Out with it, Jo. I won't be kept in the dark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have\n",
      "gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,\n",
      "and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and\n",
      "brave it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.  Mother forbade it.  Laurie has confessed,\n",
      "asked pardon, and been punished quite enough.  We don't keep silence to\n",
      "shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you\n",
      "interfere.  Please don't.  It was partly my fault, but it's all right\n",
      "now.  So let's forget it, and talk about the Rambler or something\n",
      "pleasant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang the Rambler!  Come down and give me your word that this\n",
      "harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or\n",
      "impertinent.  If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash\n",
      "him with my own hands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the\n",
      "irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,\n",
      "whatever he might say to the contrary.  She obediently descended, and\n",
      "made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or\n",
      "forgetting the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and\n",
      "not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow and hard\n",
      "to manage,\" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if\n",
      "he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with\n",
      "an air of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and\n",
      "all the king's men couldn't,\" said Jo, trying to say a kind word for\n",
      "her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?\" was the sharp answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear no, Sir.  You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a\n",
      "trifle hasty when he tries your patience.  Don't you think you are?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,\n",
      "though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief\n",
      "and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the\n",
      "table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, \"You're right, girl, I am!\n",
      "I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how\n",
      "it will end, if we go on so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you, he'll run away.\" Jo was sorry for that speech the\n",
      "minute it was made.  She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear\n",
      "much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a\n",
      "troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his\n",
      "table.  It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his youth, and\n",
      "married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered\n",
      "and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it\n",
      "sometimes, when he gets tired of studying.  I often think I should like\n",
      "to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may\n",
      "advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently\n",
      "taking the whole as a joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?  Where's your respect for\n",
      "me, and your proper bringing up?  Bless the boys and girls!  What\n",
      "torments they are, yet we can't do without them,\" he said, pinching her\n",
      "cheeks good-humoredly.  \"Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell\n",
      "him it's all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his\n",
      "grandfather.  I won't bear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't come, Sir.  He feels badly because you didn't believe him\n",
      "when he said he couldn't tell.  I think the shaking hurt his feelings\n",
      "very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began\n",
      "to laugh, and she knew the day was won.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I\n",
      "suppose.  What the dickens does the fellow expect?\" and the old\n",
      "gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir.  He says he won't come\n",
      "down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an\n",
      "absurd way.  A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and\n",
      "bring him down quite amiable.  Try it.  He likes fun, and this way is\n",
      "better than talking.  I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying\n",
      "slowly, \"You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and\n",
      "Beth.  Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this\n",
      "nonsense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to\n",
      "another after offering some deep insult.  Jo dropped a kiss on the top\n",
      "of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under\n",
      "Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive,\n",
      "decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door\n",
      "locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly\n",
      "away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for\n",
      "her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of\n",
      "countenance, \"What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?\" he\n",
      "added, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  I got it all round.  Even you cast me off over there, and I felt\n",
      "just ready to go to the deuce,\" he began apologetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my\n",
      "son.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil\n",
      "my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an\n",
      "end,\" he said dolefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it.  Men always croak\n",
      "when they are hungry,\" and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a 'label' on my 'sect',\" answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he\n",
      "went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was\n",
      "quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the\n",
      "rest of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but\n",
      "the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered.\n",
      "She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good\n",
      "deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her\n",
      "sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the\n",
      "words, 'Mrs. John Brooke', whereat she groaned tragically and cast it\n",
      "into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day\n",
      "for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.\n",
      "The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning\n",
      "early in the new year.  Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all\n",
      "day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time\n",
      "with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand.  Her once\n",
      "active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily\n",
      "airing about the house in her strong arms.  Meg cheerfully blackened\n",
      "and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for 'the dear',\n",
      "while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving\n",
      "away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to\n",
      "accept.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,\n",
      "and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible\n",
      "or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry\n",
      "Christmas.  Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had\n",
      "bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.\n",
      "After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered\n",
      "effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were\n",

      "Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid\n",

      "felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's\n",
      "gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the\n",
      "window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.  The Unquenchables had\n",
      "done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had\n",
      "worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.  Out in the garden\n",
      "stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of\n",
      "fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a\n",

      "Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.\n",
      "Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by\n",
      "Laurie in the china closet.  Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,\n",
      "as he somewhat incoherently explained.  And Amy, the dignified, tumbled\n",
      "over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her\n",
      "father's boots in the most touching manner.  Mrs. March was the first\n",
      "to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, \"Hush!\n",
      "Remember Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was too late.  The study door flew open, the little red wrapper\n",
      "appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and\n",
      "Beth ran straight into her father's arms.  Never mind what happened\n",
      "just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the\n",
      "bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\n",
      "again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\n",
      "turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\n",
      "kitchen.  As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke\n",
      "for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\n",
      "remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he\n",
      "precipitately retired.  Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\n",
      "which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\n",
      "fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\n",
      "of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\n",
      "estimable and upright young man.  Why Mr. March paused a minute just\n",
      "there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\n",
      "looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\n",
      "to imagine.  Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,\n",
      "rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat.  Jo saw\n",
      "and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\n",
      "beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, \"I hate\n",
      "estimable young men with brown eyes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat\n",
      "turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,\n",
      "browned, and decorated.  So was the plum pudding, which melted in one's\n",
      "mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a\n",
      "honeypot.  Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\n",
      "\"For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't\n",
      "roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'\n",
      "of it in a cloth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom\n",
      "Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs\n",
      "stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\n",
      "father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.  They drank\n",
      "healths, told stories, sang songs, 'reminisced', as the old folks say,\n",
      "and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the\n",
      "girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and\n",
      "as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\n",
      "to have.  Do you remember?\" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\n",
      "followed a long conversation about many things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!\" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\n",
      "and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's been a pretty hard one,\" observed Amy, watching the light\n",
      "shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,\" whispered Beth, who\n",
      "sat on her father's knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\n",
      "the latter part of it.  But you have got on bravely, and I think the\n",
      "burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\" said Mr. March,\n",
      "looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered\n",
      "round him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know?  Did Mother tell you?\" asked Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much.  Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several\n",
      "discoveries today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, tell us what they are!\" cried Meg, who sat beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is one.\" And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his\n",
      "chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and\n",
      "two or three little hard spots on the palm.  \"I remember a time when\n",
      "this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.\n",
      "It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this\n",
      "seeming blemishes I read a little history.  A burnt offering has been\n",
      "made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than\n",
      "blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will\n",
      "last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches.  Meg, my\n",
      "dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white\n",
      "hands or fashionable accomplishments.  I'm proud to shake this good,\n",
      "industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it\n",
      "away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\n",
      "in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he\n",
      "gave her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about Jo?  Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard\n",
      "and been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth in her father's ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\n",
      "unusually mild expression in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a\n",
      "year ago,\" said Mr. March.  \"I see a young lady who pins her collar\n",
      "straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang,\n",
      "nor lies on the rug as she used to do.  Her face is rather thin and\n",
      "pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for\n",
      "it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower.  She doesn't bounce, but\n",
      "moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly\n",
      "way which delights me.  I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a\n",
      "strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite\n",
      "satisfied. I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep,\n",
      "but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful\n",
      "enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew\n",
      "rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise, feeling that\n",
      "she did deserve a portion of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Beth,\" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will\n",
      "slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\"\n",
      "began their father cheerfully.  But recollecting how nearly he had lost\n",
      "her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his\n",
      "own, \"I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\n",
      "at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her\n",
      "mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on\n",
      "every one with patience and good humor.  I also observe that she does\n",
      "not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very\n",
      "pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to\n",
      "think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try\n",
      "and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay\n",
      "figures.  I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a\n",
      "graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable\n",
      "daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you thinking of, Beth?\" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her\n",
      "father and told about her ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I read in Pilgrim's Progress today how, after many troubles,\n",
      "Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies\n",
      "bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,\n",
      "before they went on to their journey's end,\" answered Beth, adding, as\n",
      "she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the instrument, \"It's\n",
      "singing time now, and I want to be in my old place.  I'll try to sing\n",
      "the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard.  I made the\n",
      "music for Father, because he likes the verses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and\n",
      "in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her\n",
      "own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song\n",
      "for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "    He that is down need fear no fall,\n",
      "    He that is low no pride.\n",

      "\n",
      "    I am content with what I have,\n",
      "    Little be it, or much.\n",
      "    And, Lord!  Contentment still I crave,\n",
      "    Because Thou savest such.\n",

      "\n",
      "Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered\n",
      "about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait\n",
      "upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed\n",
      "by kindness.  As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with\n",
      "the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then\n",
      "'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their\n",
      "happiness.  But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,\n",
      "though none confessed the fact.  Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one\n",
      "another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.  Jo had\n",
      "sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's\n",
      "umbrella, which had been left in the hall.  Meg was absent-minded, shy,\n",
      "and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name\n",
      "was mentioned.  Amy said, \"Everyone seemed waiting for something, and\n",
      "couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,\"\n",
      "and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as\n",
      "usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed\n",
      "suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one\n",
      "knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands\n",
      "imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave\n",
      "himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,\n",
      "and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does the goose mean?\" said Meg, laughing and trying to look\n",
      "unconscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't\n",
      "it?\" answered Jo scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true,\" but Meg's voice lingered\n",
      "over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.  \"Please don't\n",
      "plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there\n",
      "isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as\n",
      "before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has\n",
      "spoiled you for me.  I see it, and so does Mother.  You are not like\n",
      "your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.  I don't mean\n",
      "to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\n",
      "settled.  I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\n",
      "have it over quickly,\" said Jo pettishly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because Father said\n",
      "I was too young,\" began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little\n",
      "smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on\n",
      "that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or\n",
      "blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided\n",
      "no.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not so silly and weak as you think.  I know just what I should\n",

      "no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had\n",
      "unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color\n",
      "varying in her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?\" asked Jo more respectfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.  You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,\n",
      "and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own\n",
      "affairs of this sort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't mean to have any.  It's fun to watch other people philander, but\n",
      "I should feel like a fool doing it myself,\" said Jo, looking alarmed at\n",
      "the thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.\"  Meg\n",
      "spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often\n",
      "seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,\" said Jo,\n",
      "rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young\n",
      "to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let\n",
      "us be friends as we were.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough!  I don't believe you'll ever say\n",
      "it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do.  If he goes on like the\n",
      "rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his\n",
      "feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I won't.  I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk\n",
      "out of the room with dignity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\n",
      "exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to\n",
      "sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam\n",
      "in a given time.  Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when\n",
      "someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was\n",
      "anything but hospitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon.  I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your\n",
      "father finds himself today,\" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\n",
      "as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very well, he's in the rack.  I'll get him, and tell it you are\n",
      "here.\"  And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in\n",
      "her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her\n",
      "speech and air her dignity.  But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\n",
      "sidle toward the door, murmuring...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother will like to see you.  Pray sit down, I'll call her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't go.  Are you afraid of me, Margaret?\" and Mr. Brooke looked so\n",
      "hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.  She\n",
      "blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\n",
      "her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and\n",
      "sweet it seemed to hear him say it.  Anxious to appear friendly and at\n",
      "her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\n",
      "gratefully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish\n",
      "I could thank you for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell you how?\" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast\n",
      "in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\n",
      "eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\n",
      "and to stop and listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not,\" she said, trying to withdraw her\n",
      "hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't trouble you.  I only want to know if you care for me a little,\n",
      "Meg.  I love you so much, dear,\" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make\n",
      "it.  She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \"I don't\n",
      "know,\" so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\n",
      "little reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself\n",
      "as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in\n",
      "his most persuasive tone, \"Will you try and find out?  I want to know\n",
      "so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I\n",
      "am to have my reward in the end or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm too young,\" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\n",
      "rather enjoying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.\n",
      "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if I chose to learn it, but. . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please choose to learn, Meg.  I love to teach, and this is easier than\n",
      "German,\" broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that\n",
      "she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg\n",
      "saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the\n",
      "satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.  This nettled\n",
      "her.  Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind,\n",
      "and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\n",
      "women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her.  She felt\n",
      "excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a\n",
      "capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \"I\n",
      "don't choose.  Please go away and let me be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\n",
      "about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it\n",
      "rather bewildered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked anxiously, following her as she\n",
      "walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do.  I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says\n",
      "I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by?  I'll wait and say\n",
      "nothing till you have had more time.  Don't play with me, Meg.  I\n",
      "didn't think that of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't think of me at all.  I'd rather you wouldn't,\" said Meg, taking\n",
      "a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel\n",
      "heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor\n",
      "tramped about the room as they did.  He just stood looking at her so\n",
      "wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of\n",
      "herself.  What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had\n",
      "not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had\n",
      "met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March's arrival,\n",
      "drove straight out to see him.  The family were all busy in the back\n",
      "part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to\n",
      "surprise them.  She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started\n",
      "as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me, what's all this?\" cried the old lady with a rap of her cane\n",
      "as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Father's friend.  I'm so surprised to see you!\" stammered Meg,\n",
      "feeling that she was in for a lecture now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's evident,\" returned Aunt March, sitting down.  \"But what is\n",
      "Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief\n",
      "going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\" with another rap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were only talking.  Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\" began Meg,\n",
      "wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brooke?  That boy's tutor?  Ah! I understand now.  I know all about\n",
      "it.  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's letters,\n",
      "and I made her tell me.  You haven't gone and accepted him, child?\"\n",
      "cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! He'll hear.  Shan't I call Mother?\" said Meg, much troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet.  I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at\n",
      "once.  Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?  If you do, not one\n",
      "penny of my money ever goes to you.  Remember that, and be a sensible\n",
      "girl,\" said the old lady impressively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\n",
      "opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.  The best of\n",
      "us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and\n",
      "in love.  If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\n",
      "probably have declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was\n",
      "preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind\n",
      "that she would.  Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\n",
      "easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\n",
      "unusual spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\n",
      "to anyone you like,\" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Highty-tighty!  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll be\n",

      "not know her in this new mood.  Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so\n",
      "brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to\n",
      "love him, if she liked.  Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and\n",
      "after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she\n",
      "could, \"Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice.  I mean it\n",
      "kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake\n",
      "at the beginning.  You ought to marry well and help your family.  It's\n",
      "your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "babies.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \"This Rook is\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, but he has many warm friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll grow.  He\n",
      "hasn't any business, has he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet.  Mr. Laurence is going to help him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That won't last long.  James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and\n",
      "not to be depended on.  So you intend to marry a man without money,\n",
      "position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when\n",
      "you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better?\n",

      "indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's\n",
      "suspicions.  \"My John wouldn't marry for money, any more than I would.\n",
      "We are willing to work and we mean to wait.  I'm not afraid of being\n",
      "poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him\n",
      "because he loves me, and I...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up\n",
      "her mind, that she had told 'her John' to go away, and that he might be\n",
      "overhearing her inconsistent remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her\n",
      "pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young\n",

      "\n",
      "And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high\n",
      "dudgeon.  She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her, for when\n",
      "left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.\n",
      "Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, who said all in one breath, \"I couldn't help hearing, Meg.\n",
      "Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care\n",
      "for me a little bit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know how much till she abused you,\" began Meg.\n",

      "\"And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the\n",
      "stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced\n",
      "herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, \"Yes,  John,\" and\n",
      "hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly\n",
      "downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound\n",
      "within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to\n",
      "herself, \"She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is\n",
      "settled.  I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the\n",
      "threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth\n",
      "nearly as wide open as her eyes.  Going in to exult over a fallen enemy\n",
      "and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an\n",
      "objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid\n",
      "enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister\n",
      "enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject\n",
      "submission.  Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had\n",
      "suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables\n",
      "actually took her breath away.  At the odd sound the lovers turned and\n",
      "saw her.  Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but 'that man', as\n",
      "Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the\n",
      "astonished newcomer, \"Sister Jo, congratulate us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and\n",
      "making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a\n",
      "word.  Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming\n",
      "tragically as she burst into the room, \"Oh, do somebody go down quick!\n",
      "John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon\n",
      "the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news\n",
      "to Beth and Amy.  The little girls, however, considered it a most\n",
      "agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,\n",
      "so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles\n",
      "to the rats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great\n",
      "deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends\n",
      "by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his\n",
      "plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which\n",
      "he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both\n",
      "looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy\n",
      "was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth\n",
      "beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\n",
      "young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly\n",
      "evident Aunt March was right in calling them as 'unworldly as a pair of\n",
      "babies'.  No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old\n",
      "room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the\n",
      "family began there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\" said\n",
      "Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she\n",
      "was planning to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm sure I can't.  How much has happened since I said that! It\n",
      "seems a year ago,\" answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far\n",
      "above such common things as bread and butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the\n",
      "changes have begun,\" said Mrs. March.  \"In most families there comes,\n",
      "now and then, a year full of events.  This has been such a one, but it\n",
      "ends well, after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hope the next will end better,\" muttered Jo, who found it very hard to\n",
      "see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few\n",
      "persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or\n",
      "lessened in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope the third year from this will end better.  I mean it shall, if\n",
      "I live to work out my plans,\" said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if\n",
      "everything had become possible to him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?\" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for\n",
      "the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short\n",
      "time to me,\" answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen\n",
      "there before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have only to wait, I am to do the work,\" said John beginning his\n",
      "labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo\n",
      "to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the\n",
      "front door banged, \"Here comes Laurie.  Now we shall have some sensible\n",
      "conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good\n",
      "spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for 'Mrs. John Brooke',\n",
      "and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had\n",
      "been brought about by his excellent management.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when\n",
      "he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done though the sky\n",
      "falls,\" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his\n",
      "congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged for that recommendation.  I take it as a good omen for\n",
      "the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\" answered Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo's face\n",
      "alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don't look\n",
      "festive, ma'am, what's the matter?\" asked Laurie, following her into a\n",
      "corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and\n",
      "shall not say a word against it,\" said Jo solemnly.  \"You can't know\n",
      "how hard it is for me to give up Meg,\" she continued with a little\n",
      "quiver in her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't give her up.  You only go halves,\" said Laurie consolingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can never be the same again.  I've lost my dearest friend,\" sighed\n",
      "Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've got me, anyhow.  I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll stand\n",
      "by you, Jo, all the days of my life.  Upon my word I will!\" and Laurie\n",
      "meant what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged.  You are always a great\n",
      "comfort to me, Teddy,\" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow.  It's all right you\n",
      "see.  Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,\n",
      "Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her\n",
      "own little house.  We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I\n",
      "shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad on some\n",
      "nice trip or other.  Wouldn't that console you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen in\n",
      "three years,\" said Jo thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true.  Don't you wish you could take a look forward and see\n",
      "where we shall all be then?  I do,\" returned Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so\n",
      "happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved.\" And Jo's eyes\n",
      "went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the\n",
      "prospect was a pleasant one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of\n",
      "the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing\n",
      "the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light\n",
      "of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not\n",
      "copy.  Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who\n",
      "held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead\n",
      "him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low\n",
      "seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie,\n",
      "leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly\n",
      "head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long\n",
      "glass which reflected them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.  Whether it ever\n",
      "rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the\n",
      "domestic drama called Little Women.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding...\n",
      "\n",
      "In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free\n",
      "minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.\n",
      "And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too\n",
      "much 'lovering' in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the\n",
      "young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,\n",

      "dashing young neighbor over the way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the\n",
      "quiet family.  The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with\n",
      "his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature\n",
      "as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better\n",
      "than learning, the charity which calls all mankind 'brother', the piety\n",
      "that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.\n",
      "\n",
      "These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which\n",
      "shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many\n",
      "admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as\n",
      "naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard\n",
      "experience had distilled no bitter drop.  Earnest young men found the\n",
      "gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled\n",
      "women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the\n",
      "gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.  Sinners told their sins to the\n",
      "pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved.  Gifted men found\n",
      "a companion in him.  Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions\n",
      "than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were\n",
      "beautiful and true, although 'they wouldn't pay'.\n",
      "\n",
      "To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so\n",
      "they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his\n",
      "books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,\n",
      "anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned\n",
      "in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred\n",
      "words, husband and father.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls\n",
      "into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored so\n",
      "faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and\n",
      "bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and\n",
      "outlives death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we\n",
      "saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the\n",
      "hospitals and homes still full of wounded 'boys' and soldiers' widows,\n",

      "\n",
      "John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent\n",

      "deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love\n",
      "are very precious when both are in full bloom.  Perfectly resigned to\n",
      "his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for\n",
      "business, and earning a home for Meg.  With the good sense and sturdy\n",
      "independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more\n",
      "generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better\n",

      "love is a great beautifier.  She had her girlish ambitions and hopes,\n",
      "and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life\n",

      "\"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,\" said Amy,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her\n",
      "fine establishment.  Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling\n",
      "that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in\n",
      "the big one.  It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave\n",
      "themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.  When I\n",
      "was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get\n",
      "torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I did after a while, not to 'mess' but to learn of Hannah how things\n",
      "should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.  It was play\n",
      "then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only\n",
      "possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little\n",
      "girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help.  You\n",
      "begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will\n",
      "be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress\n",
      "of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if\n",
      "she wishes to be well and honestly served.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to\n",
      "the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all\n",
      "absorbing subject of house keeping.  \"Do you know I like this room most\n",
      "of all in my baby house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went\n",
      "upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and\n",
      "exulting over the goodly array.  All three laughed as Meg spoke, for\n",
      "that linen closet was a joke.  You see, having said that if Meg married\n",
      "'that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was\n",
      "rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her\n",
      "repent her vow.  She never broke her word, and was much exercised in\n",
      "her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she\n",
      "could satisfy herself.  Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to\n",
      "buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,\n",
      "and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the\n",
      "secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt\n",
      "March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could\n",
      "give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first\n",
      "bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.  I had a young\n",
      "friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger\n",
      "bowls for company and that satisfied her,\" said Mrs. March, patting the\n",
      "damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their\n",
      "fineness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me\n",
      "all my days, Hannah says.\"  And Meg looked quite contented, as well she\n",
      "might.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt\n",
      "basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a\n",
      "great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the\n",
      "gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here I am, Mother!  Yes, it's all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a\n",
      "kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the\n",
      "little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and\n",
      "compliments.  Bless you, Beth!  What a refreshing spectacle you are,\n",
      "Jo.  Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled\n",
      "Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an\n",
      "attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and\n",
      "everyone began to talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is John?\" asked Meg anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which side won the last match, Teddy?\" inquired Jo, who persisted in\n",
      "feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ours, of course.  Wish you'd been there to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is the lovely Miss Randal?\" asked Amy with a significant smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More cruel than ever.  Don't you see how I'm pining away?\" and Laurie\n",
      "gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the last joke?  Undo the bundle and see, Meg,\" said Beth, eying\n",
      "the knobby parcel with curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,\"\n",
      "observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of\n",
      "the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just\n",
      "swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood\n",
      "in a jiffy.  Nice thing, isn't it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of\n",
      "its powers that made them cover up their ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's gratitude for you!  And speaking of gratitude reminds me to\n",
      "mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from\n",
      "destruction.  I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\n",
      "hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked\n",
      "like a remarkably plummy one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,\" said Meg in a matronly\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as\n",
      "six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,\" responded\n",
      "the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little\n",
      "chandelier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this\n",

      "adjournment,\" he added presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother and I are going to wait for John.  There are some last things\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for\n",
      "tomorrow,\" added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque\n",
      "curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow.  I'm in such a state of exhaustion I\n",
      "can't get home without help.  Don't take off your apron, whatever you\n",
      "do, it's peculiarly becoming,\" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial\n",
      "aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his\n",
      "feeble steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,\" began Jo,\n",
      "as they strolled away together.  \"You must promise to behave well, and\n",
      "not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a prank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never do.  You are the one for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony.  I shall\n",
      "certainly laugh if you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round\n",
      "you will obscure the prospect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never cry unless for some great affliction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such as fellows going to college, hey?\" cut in Laurie, with suggestive\n",
      "laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be a peacock.  I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly.  I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?  Pretty amiable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very.  Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take\n",
      "it?\" asked Jo rather sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say 'All\n",
      "right', if it wasn't?\" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then don't go and be suspicious.  I only want some money,\" said\n",
      "Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You spend a great deal, Teddy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone\n",
      "before I know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and\n",
      "can't say 'No' to anyone.  We heard about Henshaw and all you did for\n",
      "him.  If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,\"\n",
      "said Jo warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.  You wouldn't have me let\n",
      "that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help,\n",
      "when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen\n",
      "waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I\n",
      "thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it\n",
      "breaks out in a new spot.  Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to\n",
      "make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,\n",
      "orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.  If it was cheap\n",
      "ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I\n",
      "don't get any satisfaction out of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,\n",
      "that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only\n",
      "afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a\n",
      "rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and\n",
      "stuffed it into his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul!  I have enough all\n",
      "through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get\n",
      "myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my\n",
      "friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm not\n",
      "aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks\n",
      "like a young prize fighter,\" observed Jo severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,\"\n",
      "returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having\n",

      "\"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate\n",
      "about Amy.  He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about\n",
      "in a most suspicious manner.  He'd better nip his little passion in the\n",
      "bud, hadn't he?\" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone,\n",
      "after a minute's silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course he had.  We don't want any more marrying in this family for\n",
      "years to come.  Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?\" and Jo\n",
      "looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in\n",
      "their teens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You\n",
      "are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left\n",
      "lamenting,\" said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the\n",
      "times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be alarmed.  I'm not one of the agreeable sort.  Nobody will\n",
      "want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a\n",
      "family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't give anyone a chance,\" said Laurie, with a sidelong glance\n",
      "and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. \"You won't\n",
      "show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it\n",
      "by accident and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as\n",
      "Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold water over him, and get so\n",
      "thorny no one dares touch or look at you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like that sort of thing.  I'm too busy to be worried with\n",
      "nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't\n",
      "say any more about it.  Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we\n",
      "talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.  I don't wish to get\n",
      "cross, so let's change the subject;\"  and Jo looked quite ready to\n",
      "fling cold water on the slightest provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in\n",
      "a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the\n",
      "gate, \"Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that\n",
      "morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine,\n",
      "like friendly little neighbors, as they were.  Quite flushed with\n",
      "excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,\n",
      "whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the\n",
      "dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod\n",
      "and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a\n",
      "welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,\n",
      "and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest\n",
      "baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle\n",
      "mistress who had loved and tended them so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest\n",
      "in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it\n",
      "fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,\n",
      "lace, nor orange flowers would she have.  \"I don't want a fashionable\n",
      "wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to\n",
      "look and be my familiar self.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes\n",
      "and innocent romances of a girlish heart.  Her sisters braided up her\n",
      "pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\n",
      "valley, which 'her John' liked best of all the flowers that grew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\n",
      "that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,\" cried Amy,\n",
      "surveying her with delight when all was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I am satisfied.  But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don't\n",
      "mind my dress.  I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it\n",
      "today,\"  and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her\n",
      "with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not\n",
      "changed the old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few\n",
      "minutes with Father quietly in the study,\"  and Meg ran down to perform\n",
      "these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she\n",
      "went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there\n",
      "was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the\n",
      "first bird from the nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their\n",
      "simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which\n",
      "three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their\n",
      "best just now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with\n",
      "ease, if not grace.  The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\n",
      "more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.  There is a\n",
      "fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\n",
      "gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.  The beautiful,\n",
      "kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\n",
      "although it is not sad itself.  It is the shadow of pain which touches\n",
      "the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains\n",
      "and always speaks hopefully of 'being better soon'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy is with truth considered 'the flower of the family', for at sixteen\n",
      "she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but\n",
      "possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\n",
      "lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\n",
      "dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as\n",
      "attractive to many as beauty itself.  Amy's nose still afflicted her,\n",
      "for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and\n",
      "having a decided chin.  These offending features gave character to her\n",
      "whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\n",
      "wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and\n",
      "abundant than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the\n",
      "summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just\n",
      "what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in\n",
      "their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the\n",
      "romance of womanhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as\n",
      "natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was\n",
      "scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in,\n",
      "to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and\n",
      "to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a\n",
      "grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, here's a state of things!\" cried the old lady, taking\n",
      "the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her\n",
      "lavender moire with a great rustle.  \"You oughtn't to be seen till the\n",
      "last minute, child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to\n",
      "criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon.  I'm too happy to\n",
      "care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little\n",
      "wedding just as I like it.  John, dear, here's your hammer.\"  And away\n",
      "went Meg to help 'that man' in his highly improper employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Brooke didn't even say, \"Thank you,\" but as he stooped for the\n",
      "unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door,\n",
      "with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with\n",
      "a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous\n",
      "exclamation, \"Jupiter Ammon!  Jo's upset the cake again!\" caused a\n",
      "momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins\n",
      "arrived, and 'the party came in', as Beth used to say when a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than\n",
      "mosquitoes,\" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and\n",
      "Laurie's black head towered above the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant\n",
      "if he likes,\" returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware\n",
      "of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a\n",
      "devotion that nearly distracted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room\n",
      "as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green\n",
      "arch.  Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up.\n",
      "The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the\n",
      "service more beautiful and solemn.  The bridegroom's hand trembled\n",
      "visibly, and no one heard his replies.  But Meg looked straight up in\n",
      "her husband's eyes, and said, \"I will!\" with such tender trust in her\n",
      "own face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March\n",
      "sniffed audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved\n",
      "from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring\n",
      "fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his\n",
      "wicked black eyes.  Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,\n",
      "but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\n",
      "sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly\n",
      "married, Meg cried, \"The first kiss for Marmee!\" and turning, gave it\n",
      "with her heart on her lips.  During the next fifteen minutes she looked\n",
      "more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their\n",
      "privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\n",
      "adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\n",
      "in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, \"Bless you, deary, a\n",
      "hundred times!  The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks\n",
      "lovely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\n",
      "to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are\n",
      "light.  There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the\n",
      "little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful\n",
      "lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt\n",
      "March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and\n",
      "coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes\n",
      "carried round.  No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on\n",
      "serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his\n",
      "hand and a puzzled expression on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\" he whispered, \"or am I\n",
      "merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\n",
      "morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March\n",
      "actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and\n",
      "dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home.  You know he thinks that\n",
      "wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she\n",
      "nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he\n",
      "did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous\n",
      "way, \"I like that!  For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women\n",
      "would think as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?\" and there was an anxious\n",
      "accent in Meg's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  I give you my word for it.  Don't think too well of me, either,\n",
      "this is not one of my temptations.  Being brought up where wine is as\n",
      "common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a\n",
      "pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,\n",
      "Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest\n",
      "day of my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,\n",
      "for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if\n",
      "he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her\n",
      "power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,\n",
      "but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,\n",
      "and a smile which said, \"No one can refuse me anything today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her\n",
      "his hand, saying heartily, \"I promise, Mrs. Brooke!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you, very, very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I drink 'long life to your resolution', Teddy,\" cried Jo,\n",
      "baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and\n",
      "beamed approvingly upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of\n",
      "many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy\n",
      "moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the\n",
      "house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.  Meg and\n",
      "John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,\n",
      "when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing\n",
      "touch to this unfashionable wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband\n",
      "and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in\n",
      "couples outside!\" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,\n",
      "with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their\n",
      "example without a murmur.  Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol\n",
      "began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a\n",
      "moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into\n",
      "the ring.  But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for\n",
      "when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,\n",
      "she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join\n",
      "hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young\n",
      "folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people\n",
      "began to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you'll\n",
      "be sorry for it,\" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as\n",
      "he led her to the carriage, \"You've got a treasure, young man, see that\n",
      "you deserve it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I\n",
      "don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,\" observed Mrs.\n",
      "Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get\n",
      "one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly\n",
      "satisfied,\" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to\n",
      "rest after the excitement of the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir,\" was Laurie's unusually dutiful\n",
      "reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had\n",
      "was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she\n",
      "came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and\n",
      "straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say\n",
      "'good-by', as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love\n",
      "you any the less for loving John so much,\" she said, clinging to her\n",
      "mother, with full eyes for a moment.  \"I shall come every day, Father,\n",
      "and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am\n",
      "married.  Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls\n",
      "will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank\n",
      "you all for my happy wedding day.  Good-by, good-by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender\n",
      "pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands\n",
      "full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face—and\n",
      "so Meg's married life began.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and\n",
      "genius, especially ambitious young men and women.  Amy was learning\n",
      "this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for\n",
      "inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\n",
      "For a long time there was a lull in the 'mud-pie' business, and she\n",
      "devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\n",
      "such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\n",
      "and profitable.  But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid\n",
      "aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,\n",
      "the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of\n",
      "burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic\n",
      "and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about\n",
      "promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and\n",
      "the dinner bell at her door in case of fire.  Raphael's face was found\n",
      "boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on\n",
      "the head of a beer barrel.  A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the\n",
      "sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied\n",
      "kindling for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy\n",
      "fell to painting with undiminished ardor.  An artist friend fitted her\n",
      "out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed\n",
      "away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on\n",
      "land or sea.  Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken\n",
      "prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her\n",
      "vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,\n",
      "if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging\n",
      "had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance.  Swarthy boys\n",
      "and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,\n",
      "suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in\n",
      "the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants,\n",
      "Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange\n",
      "lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash\n",
      "in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a\n",
      "king's robe, as the spectator pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row,\n",
      "looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened\n",
      "into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good,\n",
      "and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were\n",
      "pronounced 'wonderfully fine'.  A return to clay and plaster followed,\n",
      "and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or\n",
      "tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads.  Children were enticed\n",
      "in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings\n",
      "caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress.  Her\n",
      "efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an\n",
      "untoward accident, which quenched her ardor.  Other models failing her\n",
      "for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family\n",
      "were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running\n",
      "to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed\n",
      "with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened\n",
      "with unexpected rapidity.  With much difficulty and some danger she was\n",
      "dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that\n",
      "her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial\n",
      "of one artistic attempt, at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her\n",

      "If 'genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some\n",

      "she should do something worthy to be called 'high art'.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she\n",

      "friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less\n",
      "fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky\n",
      "star.  Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact.  She had\n",
      "an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the\n",
      "right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and\n",
      "place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, \"If Amy\n",

      "to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in 'our best society',\n",
      "without being quite sure what the best really was.  Money, position,\n",
      "fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable\n",
      "things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed\n",
      "them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not\n",
      "admirable.  Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she\n",
      "cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the\n",

      "poverty now excluded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lady,\" as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine\n",
      "lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate\n",

      "swan, you know.\"  and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed\n",
      "a happy temper and hopeful spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,\n",

      "perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That looks feasible.  What do you want for lunch?  Cake, sandwiches,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, no!  We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate\n",
      "and ice cream, besides.  The girls are used to such things, and I want\n",
      "my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many young ladies are there?\" asked her mother, beginning to look\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things,\n",
      "and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan\n",
      "would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much\n",
      "better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and\n",
      "attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know\n",

      "a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,\"\n",

      "obstinacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it\n",
      "was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she\n",

      "\"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way\n",
      "through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll\n",

      "decide, I'll do my best to help you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.\" and away went Amy to lay her\n",
      "plan before her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she\n",
      "possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons.\n",
      "But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with\n",
      "it at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and\n",
      "turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a\n",
      "sixpence for you?  I thought you had too much pride and sense to\n",
      "truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and\n",
      "rides in a coupe,\" said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of\n",
      "her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!\"\n",
      "returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions\n",
      "arose. \"The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great\n",
      "deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you\n",
      "call fashionable nonsense.  You don't care to make people like you, to\n",
      "go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes.  I do, and\n",
      "I mean to make the most of every chance that comes.  You can go through\n",
      "the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it\n",
      "independence, if you like.  That's not my way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the\n",
      "best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side,\n",
      "while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to\n",
      "such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an\n",
      "argument.  Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a\n",
      "good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more\n",
      "amiable turn.  Much against her will, Jo at length consented to\n",
      "sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she\n",
      "regarded as 'a nonsensical business'.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following\n",
      "Monday was set apart for the grand event.  Hannah was out of humor\n",
      "because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that \"ef the\n",
      "washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well\n",
      "anywheres\".  This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had\n",
      "a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was 'Nil\n",
      "desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to\n",
      "do it in spite of all obstacles.  To begin with, Hannah's cooking\n",
      "didn't turn out well.  The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and\n",
      "the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.  Then the cake and ice cost more\n",
      "than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which\n",
      "seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.\n",
      "Beth got a cold and took to her bed.  Meg had an unusual number of\n",
      "callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind\n",
      "that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,\n",
      "serious, and trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,\n",
      "an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree.  On\n",
      "Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more\n",
      "exasperating than a steady pour.  It drizzled a little, shone a little,\n",
      "blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for\n",
      "anyone else to make up theirs.  Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out\n",
      "of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got\n",
      "in order.  The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but\n",
      "without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the\n",
      "best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\n",
      "carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave\n",
      "an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo\n",
      "scattered about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\n",
      "it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\n",
      "would get safely home again.  The carriages were promised, Meg and\n",
      "Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah\n",
      "behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an\n",
      "absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of\n",
      "everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy\n",
      "cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch\n",
      "safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of\n",
      "artistic delights, for the 'cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were\n",
      "her strong points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\n",
      "to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.  A smart\n",
      "shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\n",
      "ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the\n",
      "exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\n",
      "perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must\n",
      "fly round and be ready for them,\" said Amy, as the sun woke her next\n",
      "morning.  She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\n",
      "said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting\n",
      "a little stale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,\"\n",
      "said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\n",
      "placid despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,\" advised\n",
      "his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at\n",
      "it.  I'm very sorry, Amy,\" added Beth, who was still a patroness of\n",
      "cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,\" said Amy\n",
      "decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I rush into town and demand one?\" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\n",
      "of a martyr.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to\n",
      "try me.  I'll go myself,\" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\n",
      "fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she\n",
      "departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and\n",
      "fit her for the labors of the day.  After some delay, the object of her\n",
      "desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further\n",
      "loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her\n",
      "own forethought.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\n",
      "Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\n",
      "find out where all her money had gone to.  So busy was she with her\n",
      "card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer,\n",
      "who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\n",
      "\"Good morning, Miss March,\" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's\n",
      "most elegant college friends.  Fervently hoping that he would get out\n",
      "before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and\n",
      "congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress,\n",
      "returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by\n",
      "learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting\n",
      "away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In\n",
      "stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and—oh horror!—the\n",
      "lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the\n",
      "highborn eyes of a Tudor!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!\" cried the unconscious youth,\n",
      "poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\n",
      "to hand out the basket after the old lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't—it's—it's mine,\" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as\n",
      "red as her fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, really, I beg pardon.  It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?\"\n",
      "said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest\n",
      "that did credit to his breeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\n",
      "and said, laughing, \"Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad\n",
      "he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind\n",
      "were touched.  The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of\n",
      "pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about 'the charming young ladies'\n",
      "diverted his mind from the comical mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see\n",
      "them, that's a comfort,\" thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,\n",
      "thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of\n",
      "dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the\n",
      "preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve\n",
      "o'clock all was ready again.  Feeling that the neighbors were\n",
      "interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of\n",
      "yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the\n",
      "'cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests\n",
      "to the banquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's the rumble, they're coming!  I'll go onto the porch and meet\n",
      "them.  It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good\n",
      "time after all her trouble,\" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the\n",
      "word.  But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable\n",
      "expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one\n",
      "young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It\n",
      "will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\"\n",
      "cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even\n",
      "for a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who\n",
      "had kept her promise.  The rest of the family, being of a dramatic\n",
      "turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a\n",
      "most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the\n",
      "merriment which possessed them.  The remodeled lunch being gaily\n",
      "partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with\n",
      "enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce),\n",
      "and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when\n",
      "'the party went out'.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she\n",
      "observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,\n",
      "except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,\" said her mother,\n",
      "as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\n",
      "thought,\" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could you spare me some of your cake?  I really need some, I have so\n",
      "much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,\" asked\n",
      "Meg soberly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take it all.  I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it\n",
      "will mold before I can dispose of it,\" answered Amy, thinking with a\n",
      "sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,\" began Jo, as they sat down\n",
      "to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the\n",
      "whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,\n",
      "\"salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn...\"\n",
      "Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the 'history of salads',\n",
      "to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.  Germans\n",
      "like messes.  I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason you\n",
      "should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,\" cried Amy,\n",
      "wiping her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about\n",
      "in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big\n",
      "nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,\" sighed\n",
      "Jo, quite spent with laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to\n",
      "satisfy you,\" said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am satisfied.  I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault\n",
      "that it failed.  I comfort myself with that,\" said Amy with a little\n",
      "quiver in her voice.  \"I thank you all very much for helping me, and\n",
      "I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at\n",
      "least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one did for several months, but the word 'fete' always produced a\n",
      "general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral\n",
      "lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her\n",
      "path.  Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\n",
      "have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her\n",
      "in this wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\n",
      "scribbling suit, and 'fall into a vortex', as she expressed it, writing\n",

      "hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\n",
      "askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,\n",
      "and cast upon the floor.  At such times the intruder silently withdrew,\n",
      "and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,\n",

      "blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat\n",
      "safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real\n",
      "and dear to her as any in the flesh.  Sleep forsook her eyes, meals\n",
      "stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness\n",
      "which blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth\n",
      "living, even if they bore no other fruit.  The divine afflatus usually\n",

      "She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was\n",
      "prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for\n",
      "her virtue was rewarded with a new idea.  It was a People's Course, the\n",
      "lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a\n",
      "subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great\n",
      "social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding\n",
      "the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy\n",

      "audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not\n",

      "her story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before\n",
      "the elopement or after the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much\n",
      "to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when\n",
      "'genius took to burning'.  Jo had never tried this style before,\n",
      "contenting herself with very mild romances for The Spread Eagle.  Her\n",
      "experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave\n",
      "her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and\n",
      "costumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\n",
      "limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\n",
      "make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\n",
      "earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript\n",
      "was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that\n",
      "if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,\n",
      "she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to\n",
      "keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all\n",
      "hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which\n",
      "almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred\n",
      "dollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had\n",
      "been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry.  If the\n",

      "devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo\n",

      "come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,\n",
      "while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was\n",
      "satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\n",
      "a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\n",
      "did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\n",
      "house, for by the magic of a pen, her 'rubbish' turned into comforts\n",
      "for them all.  The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom\n",
      "Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the\n",
      "blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.\n",

      "Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny\n",
      "side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine\n",
      "satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the\n",
      "inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful\n",
      "blessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and\n",
      "ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that\n",
      "she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and\n",
      "encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame\n",
      "and fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to\n",
      "all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling\n",
      "to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she\n",
      "would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she\n",
      "particularly admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for\n",
      "printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can\n",
      "for it.  Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is\n",
      "more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this\n",
      "important subject,\" said Jo, calling a family council.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,\n",
      "and the idea is well worked out.  Let it wait and ripen,\" was her\n",
      "father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited\n",
      "patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no\n",
      "haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by\n",
      "waiting,\" said Mrs. March.  \"Criticism is the best test of such work,\n",
      "for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her\n",
      "to do better next time.  We are too partial, but the praise and blame\n",
      "of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Jo, knitting her brows, \"that's just it.  I've been fussing\n",
      "over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or\n",
      "indifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons\n",
      "take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't leave a word out of it.  You'll spoil it if you do, for the\n",
      "interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the\n",
      "people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,\"\n",
      "said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable\n",
      "novel ever written.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a\n",
      "good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when\n",
      "you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical\n",
      "and metaphysical people in your novels,\" said Amy, who took a strictly\n",
      "practical view of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Jo, laughing, \"if my people are 'philosophical and\n",
      "metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\n",
      "except what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I've got some of his wise\n",
      "ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,\n",
      "Beth, what do you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should so like to see it printed soon,\" was all Beth said, and\n",
      "smiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last\n",
      "word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike\n",
      "candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear,\n",
      "and decided her to make her little venture 'soon'.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on\n",
      "her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of\n",
      "pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man and\n",
      "his donkey in the fable suited nobody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\n",
      "into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about\n",
      "it.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.\n",
      "Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.\n",
      "Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while\n",
      "Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo\n",
      "quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the\n",
      "story.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and\n",
      "confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into\n",
      "the big, busy world to try its fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,\n",
      "likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she\n",
      "expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it\n",
      "took her some time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.  But how can it, when\n",
      "it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a\n",
      "promising book or broken all the ten commandments?\" cried poor Jo,\n",
      "turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with\n",
      "pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  \"This man says,\n",
      "'An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.' 'All is\n",
      "sweet, pure, and healthy.'\" continued the perplexed authoress.  \"The\n",
      "next, 'The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,\n",
      "spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no\n",
      "theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my\n",
      "characters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right.\n",
      "Another says, 'It's one of the best American novels which has appeared\n",
      "for years.' (I know better than that), and the next asserts that\n",
      "'Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is\n",
      "a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't!  Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and\n",
      "nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only\n",
      "wrote it for the pleasure and the money.  I wish I'd printed the whole\n",
      "or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.\"\n",

      "Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.\n",

      "well and had apparently done so ill.  But it did her good, for those\n",
      "whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an\n",
      "author's best education, and when the first soreness was over, she\n",
      "could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel\n",
      "herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me,\" she said stoutly,\n",
      "\"and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were\n",
      "taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,\n",
      "and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced\n",
      "'charmingly natural, tender, and true'.  So I'll comfort myself with\n",
      "that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another.\"\n",

      "Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the\n",

      "every day, and never know the loss of a button.  She brought so much\n",
      "love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but\n",
      "succeed, in spite of some obstacles.  Her paradise was not a tranquil\n",
      "one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and\n",
      "bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.  She was\n",
      "too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course\n",
      "of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.  As for buttons,\n",
      "she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the\n",
      "carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,\n",
      "and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better\n",
      "than hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't\n",
      "live on love alone.  John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though\n",
      "she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.  Nor did Meg\n",
      "miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband\n",
      "followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, \"Shall I send some veal\n",
      "or mutton for dinner, darling?\" The little house ceased to be a\n",
      "glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt\n",
      "that it was a change for the better.  At first they played keep-house,\n",
      "and frolicked over it like children.  Then John took steadily to\n",
      "business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders,\n",
      "and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to\n",
      "work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's\n",
      "Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the\n",

      "to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be\n",
      "privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be\n",
      "concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little\n",
      "Hummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced\n",
      "a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would\n",
      "ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread\n",
      "pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although\n",
      "he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was\n",
      "found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young\n",

      "Fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with\n",
      "homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\n",
      "was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra\n",
      "quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be\n",
      "attended to at once.  As John firmly believed that 'my wife' was equal\n",
      "to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that\n",
      "she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\n",
      "pleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little\n",
      "pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\n",
      "her.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\n",
      "elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\n",
      "bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\n",
      "success, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array\n",
      "of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\n",
      "the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\n",
      "resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\n",
      "straining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked\n",
      "advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\n",
      "did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but\n",
      "that dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,\n",
      "but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with\n",
      "their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over\n",
      "that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,\n",
      "but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on\n",
      "without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had\n",

      "wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, \"My\n",

      "How charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to\n",

      "superior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,\n",
      "it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an\n",

      "come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull\n",

      "yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We're both as hungry\n",
      "as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and\n",
      "bread and cheese.  We won't ask for jelly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his\n",

      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr.\n",
      "Scott was not taken 'up to Mother's', and when Meg descended, after\n",
      "they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous\n",
      "lunch which filled her with horror.  Lotty reported that they had eaten\n",
      "\"a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\n",
      "sweet stuff, and hide the pots.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "short-comings, of loyalty to John, \"who might be cruel, but nobody\n",
      "should know it,\" restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she\n",
      "dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\n",
      "forgiven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light.\n",
      "He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little\n",
      "wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his\n",
      "friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but\n",
      "John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had\n",
      "deserted him in his hour of need.  \"It wasn't fair to tell a man to\n",
      "bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you\n",
      "at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to\n",
      "be laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over\n",
      "and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over\n",
      "him.  \"Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so\n",
      "heartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was\n",
      "young.  I must be patient and teach her.\"  He hoped she had not gone\n",
      "home—he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled\n",
      "again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry\n",
      "herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\n",
      "resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\n",
      "she had failed in her duty to her spouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg likewise resolved to be 'calm and kind, but firm', and show him his\n",
      "duty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and\n",
      "comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of\n",
      "the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\n",
      "as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\n",
      "\n",
      "John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling\n",
      "that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\n",
      "leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly\n",
      "relevant remark, \"We are going to have a new moon, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no objection,\" was Meg's equally soothing remark.  A few other\n",
      "topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and\n",
      "wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went\n",
      "to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\n",
      "figuratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if\n",
      "new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\n",
      "spoke.  Both looked quite 'calm and firm', and both felt desperately\n",
      "uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear,\" thought Meg, \"married life is very trying, and does need\n",
      "infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.\"  The word 'Mother'\n",
      "suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with\n",
      "unbelieving protests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see\n",
      "and bear with them, remembering your own.  He is very decided, but\n",
      "never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.\n",
      "He is very accurate, and particular about the truth—a good trait,\n",
      "though you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,\n",
      "and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.\n",
      "He has a temper, not like ours—one flash and then all over—but the\n",
      "white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to\n",
      "quench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against\n",
      "yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch\n",
      "yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\n",
      "the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\n",
      "the way for bitter sorrow and regret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\n",
      "especially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own\n",
      "hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\n",
      "own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\n",
      "such a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in\n",
      "her eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,\n",
      "thinking, \"I will be the first to say, 'Forgive me'\", but he did not\n",
      "seem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was\n",
      "hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a\n",
      "minute she felt as if she really couldn't do it, then came the thought,\n",
      "\"This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\n",
      "myself with,\" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\n",
      "forehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than\n",
      "a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\n",
      "tenderly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,\n",
      "dear.  I never will again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\n",
      "declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family\n",
      "peace was preserved in that little family jar.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\n",
      "served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\n",
      "course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\n",
      "everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a\n",
      "lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all\n",
      "the way home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat\n",
      "renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\n",
      "the little house, or inviting 'that poor dear' to come in and spend the\n",
      "day at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\n",
      "felt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and\n",
      "nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell\n",
      "out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.\n",
      "Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself\n",
      "because she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered\n",
      "her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John\n",
      "wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what\n",
      "John disliked even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\n",
      "her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\n",
      "more—his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she\n",
      "liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every\n",
      "penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's\n",
      "wife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her\n",
      "little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without\n",
      "fear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted\n",
      "her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg\n",
      "didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but\n",
      "she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console\n",
      "herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she\n",
      "had to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty\n",
      "things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't\n",
      "worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in\n",
      "the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up\n",
      "her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.\n",
      "John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he\n",
      "was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg\n",
      "never forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and\n",
      "it weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg\n",
      "longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black\n",
      "silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper\n",
      "for girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of\n",
      "twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.  That was only a month to\n",
      "wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had\n",
      "the money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his\n",
      "was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective\n",
      "five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?\n",
      "That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to\n",
      "lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg\n",
      "beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,\n",
      "shimmering folds, and said, \"A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am.\" She\n",
      "answered, \"I'll take it,\" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie\n",
      "had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no\n",
      "consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,\n",
      "and the police were after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by\n",
      "spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn't\n",
      "become her, after all, and the words 'fifty dollars' seemed stamped\n",
      "like a pattern down each breadth.  She put it away, but it haunted her,\n",
      "not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost\n",
      "of a folly that was not easily laid.  When John got out his books that\n",
      "night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,\n",
      "she was afraid of her husband.  The kind, brown eyes looked as if they\n",
      "could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had\n",
      "found her out, but didn't mean to let her know it.  The house bills\n",
      "were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was\n",
      "undoing the old pocketbook which they called the 'bank', when Meg,\n",
      "knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You haven't seen my private expense book yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so,\n",
      "and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women\n",
      "wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning\n",
      "of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three\n",
      "rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a\n",
      "bonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like\n",
      "the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her\n",
      "extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg\n",
      "got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of\n",
      "his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic\n",
      "increasing with every word...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been\n",
      "dreadfully extravagant lately.  I go about so much I must have things,\n",
      "you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year's\n",
      "money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for\n",
      "I knew you'd think it wrong in me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,\n",
      "\"Don't go and hide.  I won't beat you if you have got a pair of killing\n",
      "boots.  I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does\n",
      "pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That had been one of her last 'trifles', and John's eye had fallen on\n",
      "it as he spoke.  \"Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful\n",
      "fifty dollars!\" thought Meg, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,\" she said, with the calmness\n",
      "of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.\n",
      "\n",

      "the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough\n",
      "without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added.  For\n",

      "so.  I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and\n",
      "pitying me because I don't.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and\n",

      "The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but\n",
      "he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many\n",
      "pleasures for Meg's sake.  She could have bitten her tongue out the\n",
      "minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,\n",
      "saying with a little quiver in his voice, \"I was afraid of this.  I do\n",
      "my best, Meg.\"  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\n",
      "have broken her heart like those few words.  She ran to him and held\n",
      "him close, crying, with repentant tears, \"Oh, John, my dear, kind,\n",
      "hard-working boy.  I didn't mean it!  It was so wicked, so untrue and\n",
      "ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach,\n",
      "but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be\n",
      "forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again.  She had\n",
      "promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had\n",
      "reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings\n",
      "recklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so\n",
      "quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he\n",
      "stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry\n",
      "herself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the\n",
      "discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat\n",
      "reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had\n",
      "simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, \"I\n",
      "can't afford it, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with\n",
      "her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would\n",
      "break.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband\n",
      "better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,\n",
      "given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him\n",
      "a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings\n",
      "and failures of those he loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the\n",

      "Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present\n",
      "of it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and\n",
      "when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new\n",
      "silk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his\n",
      "present, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home\n",
      "early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning\n",
      "by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted\n",
      "little wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to\n",
      "Meg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.\n",

      "Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,\" she said invitingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him\n",

      "\"I will, I will!  Only you must be responsible for damages.\" and\n",
      "obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put\n",
      "into his arms.  A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah,\n",

      "invested with two babies instead of one.\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough\n",
      "to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the\n",
      "unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that\n",
      "Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twins, by Jupiter!\" was all he said for a minute, then turning to the\n",
      "women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added,\n",
      "\"Take 'em quick, somebody!  I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,\n",

      "regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland\n",
      "looking at a pair of infantile kittens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boy and girl.  Aren't they beauties?\" said the proud papa, beaming\n",
      "upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most remarkable children I ever saw.  Which is which?\" and Laurie bent\n",
      "like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother\n",

      "\n",
      "\"For what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don't\n",

      "a single one upsets me for a week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.  I was to finish the crayon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now, that's shirking.  It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you\n",

      "duty, and then be at peace for another six months.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she was\n",
      "mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself\n",
      "because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking\n",
      "to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make\n",
      "calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the\n",
      "formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,\n",
      "bribe, or promise.  In the present instance there was no escape, and\n",
      "having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she\n",
      "smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat\n",
      "and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint!  You don't\n",

      "with amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?  I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty\n",
      "walk on a warm day.  If people care more for my clothes than they do\n",
      "for me, I don't wish to see them.  You can dress for both, and be as\n",
      "elegant as you please.  It pays for you to be fine.  It doesn't for me,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Amy, \"now she's in a contrary fit, and will drive me\n",
      "distracted before I can get her properly ready. I'm sure it's no\n",
      "pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's\n",
      "no one to pay it but you and me.  I'll do anything for you, Jo, if\n",
      "you'll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil.\n",
      "You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and\n",
      "behave so beautifully, if you try, that I'm proud of you.  I'm afraid\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old\n",

      "and your being afraid to go anywhere alone!  I don't know which is the\n",
      "most absurd.  Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best.  You shall be\n",
      "commander of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly, will that satisfy\n",
      "you?\" said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike\n",
      "submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a perfect cherub!  Now put on all your best things, and I'll\n",
      "tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good\n",
      "impression.  I want people to like you, and they would if you'd only\n",
      "try to be a little more agreeable.  Do your hair the pretty way, and\n",
      "put the pink rose in your bonnet.  It's becoming, and you look too\n",
      "sober in your plain suit.  Take your light gloves and the embroidered\n",
      "handkerchief.  We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and\n",
      "then you can have my dove-colored one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not\n",
      "without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled\n",
      "into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet\n",
      "strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she\n",
      "put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out\n",
      "the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the\n",
      "present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her\n",
      "hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last\n",
      "touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of\n",
      "countenance, saying meekly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die\n",
      "happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're highly satisfactory.  Turn slowly round, and let me get a\n",
      "careful view.\" Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then\n",
      "fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, \"Yes,\n",
      "you'll do.  Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with\n",
      "the rose is quite ravishing.  Hold back your shoulders, and carry your\n",
      "hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch.  There's one thing you\n",
      "can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl.  I can't, but it's very nice to\n",
      "see you, and I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one.  It's\n",
      "simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic.\n",
      "Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress\n",
      "evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose\n",
      "isn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,\" said Jo, looking through\n",
      "her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the\n",
      "golden hair.  \"Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it\n",
      "up, please, ma'am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house.  The sweeping\n",

      "gracefully.  You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at once.  You'll\n",
      "never look finished if you are not careful about the little details,\n",
      "for they make up the pleasing whole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing\n",
      "up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as\n",
      "'pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window\n",
      "to watch them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so\n",
      "I want you to put on your best deportment.  Don't make any of your\n",
      "abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?  Just be calm, cool, and\n",
      "quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen\n",
      "minutes,\" said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed\n",
      "the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me see.  'Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can promise that.\n",

      "my child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during\n",
      "the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold\n",
      "correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as\n",
      "silent as the sphinx.  In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her 'charming\n",
      "novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,\n",
      "and the fashions.  Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a\n",
      "demure \"Yes\" or \"No\" with the chill on.  In vain Amy telegraphed the\n",
      "word 'talk', tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with\n",
      "her foot.  Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment\n",
      "like Maud's face, 'icily regular, splendidly null'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!\" was\n",
      "the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door\n",
      "closed upon their guests.  Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,\n",
      "but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very\n",
      "naturally laid the blame upon Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could you mistake me so?  I merely meant you to be properly\n",
      "dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and\n",
      "stone.  Try to be sociable at the Lambs'.  Gossip as other girls do,\n",
      "and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes\n",
      "up.  They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to\n",

      "imitate what is called 'a charming girl'.  I can do it, for I have May\n",
      "Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her.  See if the Lambs don't\n",
      "say, 'What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there\n",
      "was no knowing where she would stop.  Amy's face was a study when she\n",

      "ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and\n",
      "join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken\n",
      "possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to\n",
      "hear a long account of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful\n",
      "young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush\n",
      "in and rescue her.  So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who\n",
      "seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as\n",
      "the lady.  A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her\n",
      "ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with\n",
      "curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the\n",
      "fun.  One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this\n",
      "sort of conversation.\n",

      "\"She rides splendidly.  Who taught her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one.  She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting\n",

      "doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap\n",
      "because she trains them to carry ladies so well.  She has such a\n",

      "\"None of them.  She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the\n",
      "river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,\n",
      "because he was handsome and spirited.  Her struggles were really\n",
      "pathetic.  There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she\n",
      "took the saddle to the horse.  My dear creature, she actually rowed it\n",

      "She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a\n",

      "to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's\n",
      "nothing the child can't do.  Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\n",
      "Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest\n",
      "shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Any mention of her 'works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\n",

      "remark, as now.  \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read.  I write\n",

      "going to New York this winter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Miss Lamb had 'enjoyed' the story, this speech was not exactly\n",
      "grateful or complimentary.  The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake,\n",
      "but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\n",
      "for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\n",
      "abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\n",
      "mouths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amy, we must go.  Good-by, dear, do come and see us.  We are pining\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I do well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy's crushing reply. \"What\n",
      "possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\n",
      "boots, and all the rest of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's funny, and amuses people.  They know we are poor, so it's no\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\n",

      "speak,\" said Amy despairingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with\n",
      "the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\n",

      "\"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third\n",
      "mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please.  I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy's short answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll enjoy myself.  The boys are at home, and we'll have a\n",
      "comfortable time.  Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\n",
      "has a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being\n",
      "disturbed by her failure to suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\n",
      "speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the\n",
      "hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\n",
      "herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.  She\n",
      "listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\n",
      "poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\"\n",
      "regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a\n",
      "visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma\n",
      "to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\n",
      "in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and\n",
      "dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an\n",
      "inspired Frenchwoman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself\n",
      "to her heart's content.  Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady\n",
      "who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole\n",
      "family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and\n",
      "breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best\n",
      "of us—that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which\n",
      "set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming\n",
      "of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\n",
      "something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like\n",
      "that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while\n",
      "she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled.\n",
      "But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\n",
      "British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the\n",
      "proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\n",
      "this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\n",
      "that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\n",
      "should bring disgrace upon the name of March.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.  For Jo sat on the\n",
      "grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\n",
      "reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\n",
      "one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience.  One small child was\n",
      "poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating\n",
      "gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\n",
      "gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her\n",
      "damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\n",
      "again, \"It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Capital boys, aren't they?  I feel quite young and brisk again after\n",
      "that.\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\n",
      "habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\n",
      "any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his\n",
      "father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother.  Laurie says he\n",
      "is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let\n",
      "him alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You might treat him civilly, at least.  You gave him a cool nod, and\n",
      "just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\n",
      "whose father keeps a grocery store.  If you had just reversed the nod\n",
      "and the bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it wouldn't,\" returned Jo, \"I neither like, respect, nor admire\n",
      "Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a third\n",
      "cousin to a lord.  Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.\n",
      "I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman\n",
      "in spite of the brown paper parcels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo, \"so let us look amiable, and\n",
      "drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply\n",
      "grateful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo\n",
      "uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being\n",
      "told that the young ladies were engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.  We can run down\n",
      "there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our\n",
      "best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak for yourself, if you please.  Aunt March likes to have us pay\n",
      "her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It's a\n",
      "little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it\n",
      "will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping\n",
      "boys spoil them.  Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your\n",
      "bonnet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\n",
      "her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\n",
      "spotless still.  \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\n",
      "please people as it is for you.  I think of them, but it takes too much\n",
      "time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and\n",
      "let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,\n",
      "\"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they\n",
      "have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd\n",
      "remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than I am,\n",
      "because there is more of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own\n",
      "that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life for a\n",
      "person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it.  It's a\n",
      "great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a greater not to be able to hide them.  I don't mind saying that\n",
      "I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not called upon\n",
      "to tell him so.  Neither are you, and there is no use in making\n",
      "yourself disagreeable because he is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and\n",
      "how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any\n",
      "good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to manage.  But\n",
      "there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word,\n",
      "and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other\n",
      "boys,\" said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have\n",
      "convulsed the 'remarkable boy' if he had heard it.  \"If we were belles,\n",
      "or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but\n",
      "for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve\n",
      "of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a\n",
      "particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and\n",
      "puritanical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely\n",
      "because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort\n",
      "of morality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world,\n",
      "and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their\n",
      "pains.  I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the\n",
      "laughing the world would never get on without them.  We can't agree\n",
      "about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will\n",
      "get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should\n",
      "rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new ideas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some\n",
      "particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her.  It's\n",
      "my doom, and I can't help it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very\n",
      "interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a\n",
      "conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their\n",
      "nieces.  Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but\n",
      "Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased\n",
      "everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.  This amiable spirit\n",
      "was felt at once, and both aunts 'my deared' her affectionately,\n",
      "looking what they afterward said emphatically, \"That child improves\n",
      "every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy\n",
      "sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well\n",
      "in the young.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Aunt.  Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a\n",
      "table, as I have nothing but my time to give.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not,\" put in Jo decidedly.  \"I hate to be patronized, and the\n",
      "Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly\n",
      "connected fair.  I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to\n",
      "work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am willing to work.  It's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,\n",
      "and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.\n",
      "Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite right and proper.  I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It's a\n",
      "pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.  Some do not, and\n",
      "that is trying,\" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at\n",
      "Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance\n",
      "for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but\n",
      "unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see\n",
      "what goes on in the minds of our friends.  Better for us that we cannot\n",
      "as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a\n",
      "saving of time and temper.  By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of\n",
      "several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of\n",
      "holding her tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave.  I'd\n",
      "rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem!\" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you so,\" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in\n",
      "the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you speak French, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often\n",
      "as I like,\" replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old\n",
      "lady to smile affably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you about languages?\" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know a word.  I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't\n",
      "bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,\" was the\n",
      "brusque reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,\n",
      "\"You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe?  Eyes don't\n",
      "trouble you any more, do they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all, thank you, ma'am.  I'm very well, and mean to do great\n",
      "things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that\n",
      "joyful time arrives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good girl!  You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some day,\" said\n",
      "Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her\n",
      "ball for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Crosspatch, draw the latch,\n",
      "    Sit by the fire and spin,\n",
      "\n",
      "squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to\n",
      "peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry\n",
      "that it was impossible to help laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most observing bird,\" said the old lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come and take a walk, my dear?\" cried Polly, hopping toward the china\n",
      "closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I will.  Come Amy.\" and Jo brought the visit to an end,\n",
      "feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon\n",
      "her constitution.  She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy\n",
      "kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the\n",
      "impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March\n",
      "to say, as they vanished...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better do it, Mary.  I'll supply the money.\" and Aunt Carrol to\n",

      "Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was\n",
      "considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be\n",
      "invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the\n",
      "matter.  Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all\n",
      "parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her\n",
      "life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on\n",
      "easily.  The 'haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone,\n",
      "but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the\n",

      "Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then\n",
      "there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost\n",

      "May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater\n",
      "favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling\n",
      "circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.  Amy's dainty\n",
      "pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases—that was one\n",
      "thorn.  Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at\n",
      "a late party and only once with May—that was thorn number two.  But\n",
      "the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for\n",
      "her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had\n",
      "whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the\n",
      "Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her\n",
      "naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the\n",

      "the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches\n",
      "to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the\n",
      "supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a\n",
      "cold look...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\n",
      "my giving this table to anyone but my girls.  As this is the most\n",
      "prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\n",
      "the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\n",
      "this place.  I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\n",
      "the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\n",
      "another table if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this\n",
      "little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to\n",
      "utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at\n",
      "her full of surprise and trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess\n",
      "what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,\n",
      "\"Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg.  It's merely a matter\n",
      "of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this\n",
      "table is considered their proper place.  I think it very appropriate to\n",
      "you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but\n",
      "we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you\n",
      "have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower table? The\n",
      "little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged.  You could make a\n",
      "charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Especially to gentlemen,\" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy\n",
      "as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.  She colored angrily,\n",
      "but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with\n",
      "unexpected amiability...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.  I'll give up my place here\n",
      "at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\" began\n",
      "May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty\n",
      "racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so\n",
      "carefully made and so gracefully arranged.  She meant it kindly, but\n",
      "Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,\" and sweeping her\n",
      "contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that\n",
      "herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now she's mad.  Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,  Mama,\"\n",
      "said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls' quarrels are soon over,\" returned her mother, feeling a trifle\n",
      "ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which\n",
      "cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell\n",
      "to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically.\n",
      "But everything seemed against her.  It was late, and she was tired.\n",
      "Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the\n",
      "little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered\n",
      "like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless\n",
      "efforts to preserve the most perfect order.  The evergreen arch\n",
      "wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to\n",
      "tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled.  Her best\n",
      "tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's\n",
      "cheek.  She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a\n",
      "draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the\n",
      "morrow.  Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will\n",
      "sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was great indignation at home when she told her story that\n",
      "evening.  Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done\n",
      "right.  Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo\n",
      "demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean\n",
      "people to get on without her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be.  I hate such\n",
      "things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to\n",
      "show it.  They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy\n",
      "actions, won't they, Marmee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the right spirit, my dear.  A kiss for a blow is always best,\n",
      "though it's not very easy to give it sometimes,\" said her mother, with\n",
      "the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and\n",
      "practicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,\n",
      "Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her\n",
      "enemy by kindness.  She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that\n",
      "came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her\n",
      "table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling\n",
      "the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique\n",
      "cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which\n",
      "on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts.\n",
      "As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable\n",
      "pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think.\n",
      "Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little\n",
      "spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns\n",
      "and flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I ought, but I don't,\" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright\n",
      "page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not\n",
      "hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.  Amy stood a\n",
      "minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet\n",
      "rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise\n",
      "and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in\n",
      "street, school, office, or home.  Even a fair table may become a\n",
      "pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out\n",
      "of season.  Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that\n",
      "text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do,\n",
      "took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty\n",
      "things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.  They dropped their\n",
      "voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\n",
      "story and judging accordingly.  It was not pleasant, but a better\n",
      "spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving\n",
      "it.  She heard May say sorrowfully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't\n",
      "want to fill up with odds and ends.  The table was just complete then.\n",
      "Now it's spoiled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,\" suggested someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish,\n",
      "for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them.  I\n",
      "was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your\n",
      "table rather than mine.  Here they are, please take them, and forgive\n",
      "me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile,\n",
      "and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly\n",
      "thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?\" cried one girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was\n",
      "evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a\n",
      "disagreeable laugh, \"Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't sell them\n",
      "at her own table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that was hard.  When we make little sacrifices we like to have\n",
      "them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done\n",
      "it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as\n",
      "she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table\n",
      "to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that\n",
      "one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her\n",
      "table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.  Few\n",
      "cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long\n",
      "before night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The art table was the most attractive in the room.  There was a crowd\n",
      "about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and\n",
      "fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.  Amy often looked\n",
      "wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and\n",
      "happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.  It might seem no\n",
      "hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not\n",
      "only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his\n",
      "friends made it a real martyrdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\n",
      "that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\n",
      "complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.  Her mother gave\n",
      "her an extra cordial cup of tea.  Beth helped her dress, and made a\n",
      "charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by\n",
      "getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the\n",
      "tables were about to be turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so let it\n",
      "all pass and behave yourself,\" begged Amy, as she departed early,\n",
      "hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I\n",
      "know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and\n",
      "his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet.\" returned\n",
      "Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.  Presently the familiar\n",
      "tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that my boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As sure as this is my girl!\" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm\n",
      "with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Teddy, such doings!\" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be\n",
      "hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down\n",
      "before her table afterward,\" said Laurie, espousing her cause with\n",
      "warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not\n",
      "arrive in time.  I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I\n",
      "shouldn't wonder if they never came at all.  When people do one mean\n",
      "thing they are very likely to do another,\" observed Jo in a disgusted\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was\n",
      "poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are\n",
      "just as much yours as mine.  Don't we always go halves in everything?\"\n",
      "began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious, I hope not!  Half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at\n",
      "all.  But we mustn't stand philandering here.  I've got to help Amy, so\n",
      "you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very kind as to\n",
      "let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you\n",
      "forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you do it now?\" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut\n",
      "the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the\n",
      "bars, \"Go away, Teddy, I'm busy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for\n",
      "Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket arranged\n",
      "in his best manner for a centerpiece.  Then the March family turned out\n",
      "en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only\n",
      "came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and\n",
      "apparently enjoying themselves very much.  Laurie and his friends\n",
      "gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,\n",
      "encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in\n",
      "the room.  Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing\n",
      "more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the\n",
      "conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily\n",
      "surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking\n",
      "up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of\n",
      "the Chester change of base.  She reproached herself for her share of\n",
      "the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible.  She\n",
      "also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and\n",
      "considered her a model of magnanimity.  As she passed the art table,\n",
      "she glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no sign of them.\n",
      "\"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,\" thought Jo, who could forgive\n",
      "her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening, Miss Jo.  How does Amy get on?\" asked May with a\n",
      "conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be\n",
      "generous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is\n",
      "enjoying herself.  The flower table is always attractive, you know,\n",
      "'especially to gentlemen'.\" Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap,\n",
      "but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to\n",
      "praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about?  I took a fancy to buy that for\n",
      "Father,\" said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything of Amy's sold long ago.  I took care that the right people\n",
      "saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,\" returned\n",
      "May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had,\n",
      "that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked\n",
      "both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables\n",
      "as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,\" she said,\n",
      "ordering out 'Teddy's own', as the girls called the college friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but do your\n",
      "duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art in every sense\n",
      "of the word,\" said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx\n",
      "prepared to take the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,\" said little\n",
      "Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and\n",
      "getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, my son, for a small boy!\" and walked him off, with a\n",
      "paternal pat on the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Buy the vases,\" whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals\n",
      "of fire on her enemy's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but\n",
      "pervaded the hall with one under each arm.  The other gentlemen\n",
      "speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and\n",
      "wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted\n",
      "fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said\n",
      "something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam\n",
      "with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and\n",
      "anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till\n",
      "several days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she\n",
      "did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look\n",
      "which said 'forgive and forget'.  That satisfied Amy, and when she got\n",
      "home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a\n",
      "great bouquet in each.  \"The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\"\n",
      "as Laurie announced with a flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character\n",
      "than I ever gave you credit for, Amy.  You've behaved sweetly, and I\n",
      "respect you with all my heart,\" said Jo warmly, as they brushed their\n",
      "hair together late that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.  It must\n",
      "have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart\n",
      "on selling your own pretty things.  I don't believe I could have done\n",
      "it as kindly as you did,\" added Beth from her pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so.  I only did as I'd be done by.\n",
      "You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true\n",
      "gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know\n",
      "how.  I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little\n",
      "meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women.  I'm far\n",
      "from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, \"I understand now\n",
      "what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You are getting on\n",
      "faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in true politeness,\n",
      "for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you'll get\n",
      "your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be\n",
      "delighted.  A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was\n",
      "illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who\n",
      "were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me to go with her!\" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an\n",
      "uncontrollable rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear, not you.  It's Amy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mother!  She's too young, it's my turn first.  I've wanted it so\n",
      "long.  It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid.  I\n",
      "must go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo.  Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is\n",
      "not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's always so.  Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't\n",
      "fair, oh, it isn't fair!\" cried Jo passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear.  When Aunt spoke to me\n",
      "the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent\n",
      "spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said—'I\n",
      "planned at first to ask Jo, but as 'favors burden her', and she 'hates\n",
      "French', I think I won't venture to invite her.  Amy is more docile,\n",
      "will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the\n",
      "trip may give her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!  Why can't I learn to keep it\n",
      "quiet?\" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing.  When\n",
      "she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said\n",
      "sorrowfully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so\n",
      "try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by\n",
      "reproaches or regrets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try,\" said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the\n",
      "basket she had joyfully upset.  \"I'll take a leaf out of her book, and\n",
      "try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute\n",
      "of happiness.  But it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful\n",
      "disappointment,\" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held\n",
      "with several very bitter tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you\n",
      "are not going quite yet,\" whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and\n",
      "all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted\n",
      "in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears,\n",
      "and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how\n",
      "gratefully she would bear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family\n",
      "jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without\n",
      "repinings at Amy's good fortune.  The young lady herself received the\n",
      "news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\n",
      "and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\n",
      "such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\n",
      "visions of art than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as\n",
      "she scraped her best palette.  \"It will decide my career, for if I have\n",
      "any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose you haven't?\" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new\n",
      "collars which were to be handed over to Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the\n",
      "aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face\n",
      "at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\n",
      "vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you won't.  You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man,\n",
      "and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one\n",
      "will.  I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I\n",
      "should like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if\n",
      "the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\n",
      "drawing teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh.  \"If you wish it you'll have it, for your\n",
      "wishes are always granted—mine never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\n",
      "her knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum\n",
      "for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day\n",
      "comes, if it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but\n",
      "magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment\n",
      "till Amy was off.  Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue\n",
      "ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried\n",
      "till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\n",
      "steamer sailed.  Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\n",
      "suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\n",
      "and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last\n",
      "lingerer, saying with a sob...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort\n",
      "you,\" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to\n",
      "keep his word.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and\n",
      "beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from\n",
      "the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall\n",
      "the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see\n",
      "nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "London\n",
      "\n",
      "Dearest People, Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,\n",
      "Piccadilly.  It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years\n",
      "ago, and won't go anywhere else.  However, we don't mean to stay long,\n",
      "so it's no great matter.  Oh, I can't begin to tell you how I enjoy it\n",
      "all!  I never can, so I'll only give you bits out of my notebook, for\n",
      "I've done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after\n",
      "that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of\n",
      "pleasant people to amuse me.  Everyone was very kind to me, especially\n",
      "the officers.  Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary\n",
      "aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have\n",
      "nothing to do, it's a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would\n",
      "smoke themselves to death, I'm afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so\n",
      "when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself.  Such\n",
      "walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves!  It was\n",
      "almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so\n",
      "grandly.  I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much\n",
      "good.  As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or\n",
      "whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and\n",
      "tooted on the captain's speaking trumpet, she'd have been in such a\n",
      "state of rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found\n",
      "it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there,\n",
      "ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats in the\n",
      "valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning,\n",
      "but I didn't regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of\n",
      "little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead.  I\n",
      "never shall forget it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when\n",
      "I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung,\n",
      "with a look at me...\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?\n",
      "    She lives on the banks of Killarney;\n",
      "    From the glance of her eye,\n",
      "    Shun danger and fly,\n",
      "    For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wasn't that nonsensical?\n",
      "\n",
      "We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours.  It's a dirty, noisy place,\n",
      "and I was glad to leave it.  Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of\n",
      "dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved\n",
      "à la mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he\n",
      "looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned\n",
      "off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in\n",
      "them, and said, with a grin, \"There yer har, sir.  I've given 'em the\n",
      "latest Yankee shine.\"  It amused Uncle immensely.  Oh, I must tell you\n",
      "what that absurd Lennox did!  He got his friend Ward, who came on with\n",
      "us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was\n",
      "a lovely one, with \"Robert Lennox's compliments,\" on the card.  Wasn't\n",
      "that fun, girls? I like traveling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.  The trip was like riding\n",
      "through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The\n",
      "farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,\n",
      "latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors.  The\n",
      "very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in\n",
      "clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got\n",
      "nervous like Yankee biddies.  Such perfect color I never saw, the grass\n",
      "so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a\n",
      "rapture all the way.  So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to\n",
      "the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the\n",
      "rate of sixty miles an hour.  Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but\n",
      "Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. This\n",
      "is the way we went on.  Amy, flying up—\"Oh, that must be Kenilworth,\n",
      "that gray place among the trees!\"  Flo, darting to my window—\"How\n",
      "sweet!  We must go there sometime, won't we Papa?\" Uncle, calmly\n",
      "admiring his boots—\"No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a\n",
      "brewery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause—then Flo cried out, \"Bless me, there's a gallows and a man\n",
      "going up.\"  \"Where, where?\" shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts\n",
      "with a crossbeam and some dangling chains.  \"A colliery,\" remarks\n",
      "Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.  \"Here's a lovely flock of lambs all\n",
      "lying down,\" says Amy.  \"See, Papa, aren't they pretty?\" added Flo\n",
      "sentimentally.  \"Geese, young ladies,\" returns Uncle, in a tone that\n",
      "keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the Flirtations of\n",
      "Captain Cavendish, and I have the scenery all to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be\n",
      "seen but fog and umbrellas.  We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little\n",
      "between the showers.  Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off\n",
      "in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a\n",
      "muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw.  Shopping\n",
      "in Regent Street is perfectly splendid.  Things seem so cheap, nice\n",
      "ribbons only sixpence a yard.  I laid in a stock, but shall get my\n",
      "gloves in Paris.  Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?\n",
      "\n",
      "Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and\n",
      "Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that\n",
      "it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone.  It was so\n",
      "droll!  For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so\n",
      "fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up\n",
      "outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him.  He didn't hear me\n",
      "call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite\n",
      "helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck\n",
      "pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on\n",
      "poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, then, mum?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with\n",
      "an \"Aye, aye, mum,\" the man made his horse walk, as if going to a\n",
      "funeral.  I poked again and said, \"A little faster,\" then off he went,\n",
      "helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more\n",
      "aristocratic than we look.  The Duke of Devonshire lives near.  I often\n",
      "see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington's\n",
      "house is not far off.  Such sights as I saw, my dear!  It was as good\n",
      "as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and\n",
      "yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet\n",
      "coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front.  Smart maids, with\n",
      "the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep,\n",
      "dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and\n",
      "tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,\n",
      "looking so funny I longed to sketch them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotten Row means 'Route de Roi', or the king's way, but now it's more\n",
      "like a riding school than anything else.  The horses are splendid, and\n",
      "the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and\n",
      "bounce, which isn't according to our rules.  I longed to show them a\n",
      "tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in\n",
      "their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy\n",
      "Noah's Ark.  Everyone rides—old men, stout ladies, little\n",
      "children—and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair\n",
      "exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole,\n",
      "and I thought it rather a nice little idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to describe it,\n",
      "that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime! This evening we are\n",
      "going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest\n",
      "day of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning without\n",
      "telling you what happened last evening.  Who do you think came in, as\n",
      "we were at tea?  Laurie's English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn!  I\n",
      "was so surprised, for I shouldn't have known them but for the cards.\n",
      "Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English\n",
      "style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no\n",
      "crutches.  They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to\n",
      "ask us to their house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call,\n",
      "and see them as we can.  They went to the theater with us, and we did\n",
      "have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I\n",
      "talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other\n",
      "all our days.  Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of\n",
      "her ill health.  Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his\n",
      "'respectful compliments to the big hat'. Neither of them had forgotten\n",
      "Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there.  What ages ago it seems,\n",
      "doesn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop.  I\n",
      "really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late,\n",
      "with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks,\n",
      "theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say \"Ah!\" and twirl\n",
      "their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness.  I long to see\n",

      "In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns\n",
      "were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.  I enjoyed the trips\n",
      "to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for\n",
      "at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of\n",
      "pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great\n",
      "creatures.  The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular\n",
      "English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I\n",
      "could copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.  We 'did'\n",
      "London to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry\n",
      "to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when\n",
      "they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in\n",
      "hospitality, I think.  The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,\n",
      "and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I\n",

      "at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn't say a word.  And now\n",
      "we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like\n",
      "a native, and I don't know what we should do without him.  Uncle\n",
      "doesn't know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if\n",
      "it would make people understand him.  Aunt's pronunciation is\n",
      "old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we\n",
      "knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do\n",
      "the 'parley vooing', as Uncle calls it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such delightful times as we are having!  Sight-seeing from morning till\n",
      "night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes, and meeting with\n",
      "all sorts of droll adventures.  Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,\n",
      "revelling in pictures.  Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of\n",
      "the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I'm\n",
      "cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can.  She would like the relics\n",
      "of great people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and\n",
      "gray coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie\n",
      "Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword,\n",

      "lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy them.\n",
      "Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow it.  Then the\n",
      "Bois and Champs Elysees are tres magnifique. I've seen the imperial\n",

      "empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought—purple\n",

      "sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he\n",

      "We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the\n",
      "antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is very\n",
      "curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in,\n",
      "one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for\n",

      "go out.  Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most\n",
      "agreeable young man I ever knew—except Laurie, whose manners are more\n",
      "charming.  I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however,\n",

      "one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our\n",
      "windows.  We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed\n",
      "us Fred and the students singing away down below.  It was the most\n",
      "romantic thing I ever saw—the river, the bridge of boats, the great\n",
      "fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart\n",
      "of stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble\n",
      "for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing\n",
      "away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.  Next morning Fred showed me\n",
      "one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very\n",
      "sentimental.  I laughed at him, and said I didn't throw it, but Flo,\n",
      "which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and\n",
      "turned sensible again.  I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that\n",
      "boy, it begins to look like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost\n",
      "some money, and I scolded him.  He needs someone to look after him when\n",
      "Frank is not with him.  Kate said once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I\n",
      "quite agree with her that it would be well for him.  Frankfurt was\n",
      "delightful.  I saw Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's\n",
      "famous 'Ariadne.'  It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it\n",
      "more if I had known the story better.  I didn't like to ask, as\n",
      "everyone knew it or pretended they did.  I wish Jo would tell me all\n",
      "about it.  I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything,\n",
      "and it mortifies me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just\n",
      "gone.  He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him.\n",
      "I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the\n",
      "serenade night.  Since then I've begun to feel that the moonlight\n",
      "walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him\n",
      "than fun.  I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you\n",
      "said to me, and have done my very best.  I can't help it if people like\n",
      "me.  I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for\n",
      "them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart.  Now I know Mother will\n",
      "shake her head, and the girls say, \"Oh, the mercenary little wretch!\",\n",
      "but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,\n",
      "though I'm not madly in love.  I like him, and we get on comfortably\n",
      "together.  He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich—ever so\n",
      "much richer than the Laurences.  I don't think his family would object,\n",
      "and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous\n",
      "people, and they like me.  Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the\n",
      "estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is!  A city house in a\n",
      "fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as\n",
      "comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe\n",
      "in.  I like it, for it's genuine.  I've seen the plate, the family\n",
      "jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its\n",
      "park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses.  Oh, it would be\n",
      "all I should ask!  And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls\n",
      "snap up so readily, and find nothing behind.  I may be mercenary, but I\n",
      "hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can\n",
      "help.  One of us must marry well.  Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't\n",
      "yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round.  I wouldn't marry\n",
      "a man I hated or despised.  You may be sure of that, and though Fred is\n",
      "not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond\n",
      "enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.\n",
      "So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it\n",
      "was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me.  He said nothing, but\n",
      "little things showed it.  He never goes with Flo, always gets on my\n",
      "side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we\n",
      "are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me.\n",
      "Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then\n",
      "said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about 'ein\n",
      "wonderschones Blondchen', Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his\n",
      "meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.  He isn't one of the\n",
      "cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood\n",
      "in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all\n",
      "of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post\n",
      "Restante for letters.  We had a charming time poking about the ruins,\n",
      "the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by\n",
      "the elector long ago for his English wife.  I liked the great terrace\n",
      "best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms\n",
      "inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the\n",
      "wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it.  I felt as if I'd\n",
      "got into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through\n",
      "the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and\n",
      "waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.  I had a feeling that\n",
      "something was going to happen and I was ready for it.  I didn't feel\n",
      "blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying through the\n",
      "great arch to find me.  He looked so troubled that I forgot all about\n",
      "myself, and asked what the matter was.  He said he'd just got a letter\n",
      "begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill.  So he was going at\n",
      "once on the night train and only had time to say good-by.  I was very\n",
      "sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute\n",
      "because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I could\n",
      "not mistake,  \"I shall soon come back, you won't forget me, Amy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and\n",
      "there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was\n",
      "off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to\n",
      "speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised\n",
      "his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash\n",
      "boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.  We shall\n",
      "soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say \"Yes,\n",
      "thank you,\" when he says \"Will you, please?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course this is all very private, but I wished you to know what was\n",
      "going on.  Don't be anxious about me, remember I am your 'prudent Amy',\n",
      "and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits. I'm sure\n",
      "there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think so, Mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as much as\n",
      "she used.  I found her crying over the babies the other day.  When she\n",
      "sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in\n",
      "her face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you asked her about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed\n",
      "quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's, and after\n",
      "sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, \"I think she is growing up,\n",
      "and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets,\n",
      "without knowing why or being able to explain them.  Why, Mother, Beth's\n",
      "eighteen, but we don't realize it, and treat her like a child,\n",
      "forgetting she's a woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So she is.  Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,\" returned her mother\n",
      "with a sigh and a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of\n",

      "never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a great comfort, Jo.  I always feel strong when you are at home,\n",

      "but when the tug comes, you are always ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must always be\n",
      "one scrub in a family.  Amy is splendid in fine works and I'm not, but\n",
      "I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Happy woman!  I've got heaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, what are they?\"\n",

      "not very wearing, so they'll keep.\" and Jo stitched away, with a wise\n",
      "nod which set her mother's heart at rest about her for the present at\n",
      "least.\n",
      "\n",
      "While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and\n",
      "after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which\n",
      "seemed to explain the change in her.  A slight incident gave Jo the\n",
      "clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did\n",
      "the rest.  She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon,\n",
      "when she and Beth were alone together.  Yet as she scribbled, she kept\n",
      "her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet.  Sitting at the\n",
      "window, Beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head\n",
      "upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the\n",
      "dull, autumnal landscape.  Suddenly some one passed below, whistling\n",
      "like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, \"All serene! Coming\n",
      "in tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\n",
      "till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, \"How\n",
      "strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum!\" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the bright\n",
      "color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a\n",
      "tear lay shining on the window ledge.  Beth whisked it off, and in her\n",
      "half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.\n",
      "Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about\n",
      "needing more paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\" she said, sitting down in her own\n",
      "room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had\n",
      "just made.  \"I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say?  I\n",
      "wonder if her...\"  there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden\n",
      "thought.  \"If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be.\n",
      "He must.  I'll make him!\" and she shook her head threateningly at the\n",
      "picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\n",
      "\"Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.  Here's Meg married and a\n",
      "mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.  I'm the only\n",
      "one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.\" Jo thought intently\n",
      "for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out\n",
      "her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face\n",
      "opposite, \"No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more\n",
      "stability than a weathercock.  So you needn't write touching notes and\n",
      "smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I\n",
      "won't have it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake\n",
      "till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\n",
      "only confirmed her suspicion.  Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\n",
      "with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\n",
      "but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\n",
      "cared more for her than for the others.  Indeed, a general impression\n",
      "had prevailed in the family of late that 'our boy' was getting fonder\n",
      "than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject\n",
      "and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known\n",
      "the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they\n",
      "would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, \"I told you so.\"\n",
      "But Jo hated 'philandering', and wouldn't allow it, always having a\n",
      "joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,\n",
      "but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much\n",
      "amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,\n",
      "despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\n",
      "conferences.  But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at\n",
      "many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\n",
      "occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.  Then he avoided the tender\n",
      "subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\n",
      "and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to graduate in a\n",
      "blaze of glory.  This suited the young lady better than twilight\n",
      "confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\n",
      "eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\n",
      "imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former\n",
      "could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter\n",
      "were less manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo\n",
      "watched Laurie that night as she had never done before.  If she had not\n",
      "got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\n",
      "the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.  But\n",
      "having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\n",
      "a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\n",
      "of romance writing, did not come to the rescue.  As usual Beth lay on\n",
      "the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\n",
      "sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly 'spin', and he never\n",
      "disappointed her.  But that evening Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested\n",
      "on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that\n",
      "she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\n",
      "cricket match, though the phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off\n",
      "his ground', and 'the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her\n",
      "as Sanskrit.  She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,\n",
      "that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that\n",
      "he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a\n",
      "little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an\n",
      "assiduity that was really almost tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who knows?  Stranger things have happened,\" thought Jo, as she fussed\n",
      "about the room.  \"She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\n",
      "life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love\n",
      "each other.  I don't see how he can help it, and I do believe he would\n",
      "if the rest of us were out of the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she\n",
      "ought to dispose of herself with all speed.  But where should she go?\n",
      "And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she\n",
      "sat down to settle that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa—long, broad,\n",
      "well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the\n",
      "girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,\n",
      "rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested\n",
      "tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young\n",
      "women.  They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner\n",
      "had always been Jo's favorite lounging place.  Among the many pillows\n",
      "that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with\n",
      "prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.\n",
      "This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon\n",
      "of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep\n",
      "aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when\n",
      "romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he\n",
      "most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner.  If 'the sausage' as they\n",
      "called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and\n",
      "repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child\n",
      "who dared disturb it!  That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner,\n",
      "and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form\n",
      "appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both\n",
      "long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of\n",
      "satisfaction...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, this is filling at the price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No slang,\" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.  But it was too late,\n",
      "there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared\n",
      "in a most mysterious manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, Jo, don't be thorny.  After studying himself to a skeleton all\n",
      "the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beth will pet you.  I'm busy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing,\n",
      "unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it.  Have you? Do you hate\n",
      "your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,\n",
      "but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern query, \"How\n",
      "many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not one, upon my word.  She's engaged.  Now then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances, sending\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't let me\n",

      "showed him many samples.  Jo knew that 'young Laurence' was regarded as\n",
      "a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their\n",
      "daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\n",
      "of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be\n",

      "dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar\n",
      "smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels\n",
      "rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them\n",

      "with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep.  Feeling\n",
      "that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\n",
      "manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,\n",
      "blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the\n",

      "While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, did she?\" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to\n",

      "buttons on her boots.  \"Well, you can leave it, if you like.  We've\n",

      "Now, Jo did not like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at\n",
      "all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\n",
      "bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\n",
      "apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was\n",
      "perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the\n",
      "gentlemen that her little fiction of 'my friend' was considered a good\n",
      "joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\n",
      "he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.  Half resolving never\n",
      "to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\n",

      "\"We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't object to a few\n",

      "\n",
      "Jo hardly knew her own MS.  again, so crumpled and underscored were its\n",
      "pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being\n",
      "asked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new\n",
      "cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I\n",
      "took care to have a few of my sinners repent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.  Morals don't\n",

      "\"Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up—language good, and so\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What do you—that is, what compensation—\" began Jo, not exactly\n",
      "knowing how to express herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this\n",
      "sort.  Pay when it comes out,\" returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point\n",
      "had escaped him.  Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, you can have it,\" said Jo, handing back the story with a\n",
      "satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five\n",
      "seemed good pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better\n",

      "emboldened by her success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we'll look at it.  Can't promise to take it.  Tell her to make\n",
      "it short and spicy, and never mind the moral.  What name would your\n",
      "friend like to put on it?\" in a careless tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to appear and\n",
      "has no nom de plume,\" said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as she likes, of course.  The tale will be out next week. Will\n",
      "you call for the money, or shall I send it?\" asked Mr. Dashwood, who\n",
      "felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll call.  Good morning, Sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful\n",
      "remark, \"Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her\n",
      "model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational\n",
      "literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,\n",
      "she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and\n",
      "scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared\n",
      "upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit\n",
      "as could be expected.  Her readers were not particular about such\n",
      "trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood\n",
      "graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not\n",
      "thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his\n",
      "hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher\n",
      "wages, had basely left him in the lurch.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\n",
      "stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the\n",
      "mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed.  One\n",
      "thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell\n",
      "them at home.  She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not\n",
      "approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon\n",
      "afterward.  It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with\n",
      "her stories.  Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but\n",
      "promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\n",
      "nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\n",
      "conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show\n",
      "her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could\n",
      "not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers,\n",
      "history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and\n",
      "lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose.  Jo soon found\n",
      "that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the\n",
      "tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business\n",
      "light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic\n",
      "energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them\n",
      "original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers\n",
      "for accidents, incidents, and crimes.  She excited the suspicions of\n",
      "public librarians by asking for works on poisons.  She studied faces in\n",
      "the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.\n",
      "She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old\n",
      "that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,\n",
      "and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.  She thought\n",
      "she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to\n",
      "desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character.\n",
      "She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its\n",
      "influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on\n",
      "dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent\n",
      "bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side\n",
      "of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\n",
      "other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and\n",
      "speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young\n",
      "minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own\n",
      "punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\n",
      "character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\n",
      "brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\n",
      "perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who\n",
      "interested her in spite of many human imperfections.  Mr. Bhaer, in one\n",
      "of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and\n",
      "lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a\n",
      "writer.  Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and\n",
      "studied him—a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he\n",
      "known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.  He was neither\n",
      "rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called\n",
      "fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a\n",
      "genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as\n",
      "about a warm hearth.  He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving\n",
      "something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer\n",
      "young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face\n",
      "looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his\n",
      "sake.  Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last\n",
      "decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle.  If he had\n",
      "any sorrow, 'it sat with its head under its wing', and he turned only\n",
      "his sunny side to the world.  There were lines upon his forehead, but\n",
      "Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\n",
      "others.  The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\n",
      "friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and\n",
      "his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\n",
      "wearer.  They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\n",
      "comfortable.  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\n",
      "underneath.  His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\n",
      "plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.\n",
      "His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\n",
      "like other people's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's it!\" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\n",
      "genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify and dignify\n",
      "even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own\n",
      "socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\n",
      "respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\n",
      "Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\n",
      "and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\n",
      "honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\n",
      "to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss\n",
      "Norton divulged the pleasing fact.  From her Jo learned it, and liked\n",
      "it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it.  She felt proud\n",
      "to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor\n",
      "language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much\n",
      "beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.\n",
      "Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\n",
      "unexpected manner.  Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which\n",
      "Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.  The solitary woman\n",
      "felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\n",
      "favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor.  She took them with\n",
      "her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several\n",
      "celebrities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had\n",
      "worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.  But her reverence for\n",
      "genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\n",
      "recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\n",
      "women after all.  Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\n",
      "admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\n",
      "'spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him devouring his supper with an\n",
      "ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.  Turning as from a\n",
      "fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\n",
      "romantic illusions.  The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\n",
      "with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly\n",
      "with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at\n",
      "another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering\n",
      "her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea\n",
      "Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady\n",
      "rendering speech impossible.  The scientific celebrities, forgetting\n",
      "their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting\n",
      "themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young\n",
      "musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked\n",
      "horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be\n",
      "the most ordinary man of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,\n",
      "that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\n",
      "her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\n",
      "philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\n",
      "intellectual tournament in the recess.  The conversations were miles\n",
      "beyond Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel\n",
      "were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,\n",
      "and the only thing 'evolved from her inner consciousness' was a bad\n",
      "headache after it was all over.  It dawned upon her gradually that the\n",
      "world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,\n",
      "according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,\n",
      "that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and\n",
      "intellect was to be the only God.  Jo knew nothing about philosophy or\n",
      "metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,\n",
      "half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being\n",
      "turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a\n",
      "holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\n",
      "looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\n",
      "He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated\n",
      "just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat,\n",
      "trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after\n",
      "they had annihilated all the old beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions,\n",
      "not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\n",
      "lightly spoken.  As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\n",
      "attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit\n",
      "his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\n",
      "would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over\n",
      "that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an\n",
      "opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion\n",
      "with all the eloquence of truth—an eloquence which made his broken\n",
      "English musical and his plain face beautiful.  He had a hard fight, for\n",
      "the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and\n",
      "stood to his colors like a man.  Somehow, as he talked, the world got\n",
      "right again to Jo.  The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\n",
      "better than the new.  God was not a blind force, and immortality was\n",
      "not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.  She felt as if she had solid\n",
      "ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but\n",
      "not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor\n",
      "her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\n",
      "then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent.\n",
      "She began to see that character is a better possession than money,\n",
      "rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a\n",
      "wise man has defined it to be, 'truth, reverence, and good will', then\n",
      "her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.\n",
      "\n",
      "This belief strengthened daily.  She valued his esteem, she coveted his\n",
      "respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the\n",
      "wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything.  It all grew\n",
      "out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo\n",
      "her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put\n",
      "there and he had forgotten to take off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,\" thought\n",
      "Jo, with a smile, as he said \"Goot efening,\" and sat soberly down,\n",
      "quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\n",
      "headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\n",
      "hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover\n",
      "it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German\n",
      "read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.  After the reading\n",
      "came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that\n",
      "night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.  The\n",
      "Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask\n",
      "with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no\n",
      "respect for me, that you go on so bad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\"\n",
      "said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt\n",
      "and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then\n",
      "threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my\n",
      "cap.  Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,\n",
      "you too shall wear him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer\n",
      "caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great\n",
      "disgust, \"I wish these papers did not come in the house.  They are not\n",
      "for children to see,  nor young people to read. It is not well, and I\n",
      "haf no patience with those who make this harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\n",
      "lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper.  She did not like it, but\n",
      "the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but\n",
      "fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.  It\n",
      "was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if\n",
      "it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no\n",
      "name to betray her.  She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a\n",
      "blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more\n",
      "than people fancied.  He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among\n",
      "the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he\n",
      "asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work.  Now it\n",
      "occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\n",
      "troubled him.  He did not say to himself, \"It is none of my business.\n",
      "I've no right to say anything,\" as many people would have done.  He\n",
      "only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from\n",
      "mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an\n",
      "impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out\n",
      "his hand to save a baby from a puddle.  All this flashed through his\n",
      "mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by\n",
      "the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready\n",
      "to say quite naturally, but very gravely...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you are right to put it from you.  I do not think that good young\n",
      "girls should see such things.  They are made pleasant to some, but I\n",
      "would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad\n",
      "trash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for\n",
      "it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people\n",
      "make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,\" said\n",
      "Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits\n",
      "followed her pin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to\n",
      "sell it.  If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\n",
      "not feel that the living was honest.  They haf no right to put poison\n",
      "in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it.  No, they should think\n",
      "a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\n",
      "his hands.  Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for\n",
      "her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and\n",
      "gone harmlessly up the chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like much to send all the rest after him,\" muttered the\n",
      "Professor, coming back with a relieved air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\n",
      "hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\n",
      "Then she thought consolingly to herself, \"Mine are not like that, they\n",
      "are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,\" and taking up her\n",
      "book, she said, with a studious face, \"Shall we go on, Sir? I'll be\n",
      "very good and proper now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall hope so,\" was all he said, but he meant more than she\n",
      "imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the\n",
      "words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully\n",
      "reread every one of her stories.  Being a little shortsighted, Mr.\n",
      "Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling\n",
      "to see how they magnified the fine print of her book.  Now she seemed\n",
      "to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the\n",
      "faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her\n",
      "with dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is\n",
      "more sensational than the last.  I've gone blindly on, hurting myself\n",
      "and other people, for the sake of money.  I know it's so, for I can't\n",
      "read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,\n",
      "and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of\n",
      "them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\n",
      "stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd better\n",
      "burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves\n",
      "up with my gunpowder,\" she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura\n",
      "whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except a heap\n",
      "of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\n",
      "floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my\n",
      "time,\" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \"I almost\n",
      "wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient.  If I didn't care\n",
      "about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\n",
      "should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother\n",
      "and Father hadn't been so particular about such things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Father and Mother were\n",
      "particular', and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians\n",
      "to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to\n",
      "impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build\n",
      "character upon in womanhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not\n",
      "pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as\n",
      "is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs.\n",
      "Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale\n",
      "which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so\n",
      "intensely moral was it.  She had her doubts about it from the\n",
      "beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease\n",
      "in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and\n",
      "cumbrous costume of the last century.  She sent this didactic gem to\n",
      "several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to\n",
      "agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of\n",
      "if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.\n",
      "The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\n",
      "juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\n",
      "convert all the world to his particular belief.  But much as she liked\n",
      "to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty\n",
      "boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did\n",
      "not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did\n",
      "go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to\n",
      "escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons\n",
      "on their lisping tongues.  So nothing came of these trials, and Jo\n",
      "corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know anything.  I'll wait until I do before I try again, and\n",
      "meantime, 'sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better, that's\n",
      "honest, at least.\"  Which decision proved that her second tumble down\n",
      "the beanstalk had done her some good.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\n",
      "been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked\n",
      "serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer.  He did\n",
      "it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\n",
      "accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was\n",
      "satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she\n",
      "had given up writing.  Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\n",
      "second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\n",
      "evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\n",
      "studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\n",
      "occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was\n",
      "happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons\n",
      "besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her\n",
      "own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.\n",
      "Kirke till June.  Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.  The\n",
      "children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all\n",
      "over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going home?  Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\" he said,\n",
      "when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner,\n",
      "while she held a little levee on that last evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when\n",
      "his turn came, she said warmly, \"Now, Sir, you won't forget to come and\n",
      "see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never forgive you if\n",
      "you do, for I want them all to know my friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you?  Shall I come?\" he asked, looking down at her with an eager\n",
      "expression which she did not see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, come next month.  Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy\n",
      "commencement as something new.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?\" he said in an altered\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my boy Teddy.  I'm very proud of him and should like you to see\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure\n",
      "in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.\n",
      "Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more\n",
      "than a 'best friend', and simply because she particularly wished not to\n",
      "look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush,\n",
      "and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew.  If it had not been\n",
      "for Tina on her knee.  She didn't know what would have become of her.\n",
      "Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her\n",
      "face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and\n",
      "his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual\n",
      "expression, as he said cordially...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much\n",
      "success, and you all happiness.  Gott bless you!\"  And with that, he\n",
      "shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the\n",
      "tired look on his face and the 'heimweh', or homesickness, lying heavy\n",
      "at his heart.  Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little\n",
      "child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head\n",
      "on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search\n",
      "of something that he could not find.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not for me, I must not hope it now,\" he said to himself, with a\n",
      "sigh that was almost a groan.  Then, as if reproaching himself for the\n",
      "longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled\n",
      "heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened\n",
      "his Plato.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found that a\n",
      "pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very\n",
      "satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and\n",
      "thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory\n",
      "of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her\n",
      "company, and best of all, the happy thought, \"Well, the winter's gone,\n",
      "and I've written no books, earned no fortune, but I've made a friend\n",
      "worth having and I'll try to keep him all my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose\n",
      "that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with\n",
      "the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his\n",
      "friends said.  They were all there, his grandfather—oh, so proud—Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him\n",
      "with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but\n",
      "fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early\n",
      "tomorrow.  You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?\" Laurie said, as he\n",
      "put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.\n",
      "He said 'girls', but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up\n",
      "the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid,\n",
      "successful boy anything, and answered warmly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing 'Hail\n",
      "the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic,\n",
      "\"Oh, deary me!  I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and\n",
      "having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were\n",
      "going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her\n",
      "answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy\n",
      "wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings.  A call at\n",
      "Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still\n",
      "further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart\n",
      "figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about\n",
      "and run away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?\" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within\n",
      "speaking distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot it.\" And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not\n",
      "be called lover-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not,\n",
      "and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly\n",
      "about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road\n",
      "into the little path that led homeward through the grove.  Then he\n",
      "walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now\n",
      "and then a dreadful pause occurred.  To rescue the conversation from\n",
      "one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said\n",
      "hastily, \"Now you must have a good long holiday!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I intend to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him\n",
      "looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded\n",
      "moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, \"No,\n",
      "Teddy.  Please don't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, and you must hear me.  It's no use, Jo, we've got to have it\n",
      "out, and the sooner the better for both of us,\" he answered, getting\n",
      "flushed and excited all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say what you like then.  I'll listen,\" said Jo, with a desperate sort\n",
      "of patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to 'have it\n",
      "out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with\n",
      "characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now\n",
      "and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it, you've\n",
      "been so good to me.  I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me.\n",
      "Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can't go\n",
      "on so any longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wanted to save you this.  I thought you'd understand...\" began Jo,\n",
      "finding it a great deal harder than she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they\n",
      "mean.  They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits\n",
      "just for the fun of it,\" returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an\n",
      "undeniable fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't.  I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away\n",
      "to keep you from it if I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so.  It was like you, but it was no use.  I only loved you\n",
      "all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards\n",
      "and everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I\n",
      "hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough...\" Here there was\n",
      "a choke that couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while\n",
      "he cleared his 'confounded throat'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful\n",
      "to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I can't love you\n",
      "as you want me to.  I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it\n",
      "would be a lie to say I do when I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, truly, Jo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with\n",
      "a look that she did not soon forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, truly, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words\n",
      "fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as\n",
      "if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him.\n",
      "So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still\n",
      "that Jo was frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it\n",
      "would do any good!  I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, I can't help\n",
      "it.  You know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other\n",
      "people if they don't,\" cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she\n",
      "softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted\n",
      "her so long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do sometimes,\" said a muffled voice from the post. \"I don't\n",
      "believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try it,\" was\n",
      "the decided answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow\n",
      "by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said\n",
      "very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, \"Laurie, I want\n",
      "to tell you something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in\n",
      "a fierce tone, \"Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear it now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell what?\" she asked, wondering at his violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you love that old man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What old man?\" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you\n",
      "love him, I know I shall do something desperate;\" and he looked as if\n",
      "he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark\n",
      "in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she\n",
      "too, was getting excited with all this, \"Don't swear, Teddy!  He isn't\n",
      "old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I've got,\n",
      "next to you.  Pray, don't fly into a passion.  I want to be kind, but I\n",
      "know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor.  I haven't the least\n",
      "idea of loving him or anybody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this\n",
      "trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never!\n",
      "Never!\" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I do with him?\" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more\n",
      "unmanagable than she expected.  \"You haven't heard what I wanted to\n",
      "tell you.  Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make\n",
      "you happy,\" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which\n",
      "proved that she knew nothing about love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on\n",
      "the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,\n",
      "and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was\n",
      "not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part, for how\n",
      "could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes\n",
      "full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or\n",
      "two her hardness of heart had wrung from him?  She gently turned his\n",
      "head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed\n",
      "to grow for her sake—how touching that was, to be sure! \"I agree with\n",
      "Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick\n",
      "tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we\n",
      "were so foolish as to...\" Jo paused a little over the last word, but\n",
      "Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marry—no we shouldn't!  If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect\n",
      "saint, for you could make me anything you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I can't.  I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by\n",
      "such a serious experiment.  We don't agree and we never shall, so we'll\n",
      "be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything rash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we will if we get the chance,\" muttered Laurie rebelliously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\" implored\n",
      "Jo, almost at her wit's end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't be reasonable.  I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible\n",
      "view'.  It won't help me, and it only makes it harder.  I don't believe\n",
      "you've got any heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I hadn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good omen,\n",
      "Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\n",
      "said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\n",
      "wheedlesome before, \"Don't disappoint us, dear!  Everyone expects it.\n",
      "Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get\n",
      "on without you.  Say you will, and let's be happy.  Do, do!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength\n",
      "of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided\n",
      "that she did not love her boy, and never could.  It was very hard to\n",
      "do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't say 'yes' truly, so I won't say it at all.  You'll see that\n",
      "I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...\" she began solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\n",
      "with indignation at the very idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you will!\" persisted Jo.  \"You'll get over this after a while,\n",
      "and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a\n",
      "fine mistress for your fine house.  I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward\n",
      "and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel—we\n",
      "can't help it even now, you see—and I shouldn't like elegant society\n",
      "and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on\n",
      "without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and\n",
      "everything would be horrid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything more?\" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\n",
      "this prophetic burst.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry.  I'm\n",
      "happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it\n",
      "up for any mortal man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know better!\" broke in Laurie.  \"You think so now, but there'll come\n",
      "a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll love him\n",
      "tremendously, and live and die for him.  I know you will, it's your\n",
      "way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,\" and the despairing lover\n",
      "cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed\n",
      "comical, if his face had not been so tragic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\n",
      "him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\" cried Jo,\n",
      "losing patience with poor Teddy.  \"I've done my best, but you won't be\n",
      "reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't\n",
      "give.  I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,\n",
      "but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for\n",
      "both of us—so now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That speech was like gunpowder.  Laurie looked at her a minute as if he\n",
      "did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,\n",
      "saying in a desperate sort of tone, \"You'll be sorry some day, Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, where are you going?\" she cried, for his face frightened her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the devil!\" was the consoling answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank\n",
      "toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a\n",
      "young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort\n",
      "who are conquered by a single failure.  He had no thought of a\n",
      "melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\n",
      "coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\n",
      "up the river than he had done in any race.  Jo drew a long breath and\n",
      "unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\n",
      "the trouble which he carried in his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent\n",
      "state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him,\" she said, adding, as she\n",
      "went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\n",
      "and buried it under the leaves.  \"Now I must go and prepare Mr.\n",
      "Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.  I wish he'd love Beth,\n",
      "perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.\n",
      "Oh dear!  How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?  I think\n",
      "it's dreadful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went\n",
      "straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then\n",
      "broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind\n",
      "old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.\n",
      "He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving\n",
      "Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better\n",
      "than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and\n",
      "resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's\n",
      "parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather\n",
      "met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\n",
      "successfully for an hour or two.  But when they sat together in the\n",
      "twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\n",
      "old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\n",
      "listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed\n",
      "like love's labor lost.  He bore it as long as he could, then went to\n",
      "his piano and began to play.  The windows were open, and Jo, walking\n",
      "in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her\n",
      "sister, for he played the 'Sonata Pathetique', and played it as he\n",
      "never did before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry.\n",
      "Give us something gayer, lad,\" said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart\n",
      "was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several\n",
      "minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull\n",
      "Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, \"Jo, dear, come in.  I\n",
      "want you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he\n",
      "listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and\n",
      "the musician sat silent in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't stand this,\" muttered the old gentleman.  Up he got, groped\n",
      "his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad\n",
      "shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, \"I know, my boy, I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, \"Who told you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then there's an end of it!\"  And he shook off his grandfather's hands\n",
      "with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his\n",
      "man's pride could not bear a man's pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite.  I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\n",
      "it,\" returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. \"You won't care to\n",
      "stay at home now, perhaps?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to run away from a girl.  Jo can't prevent my seeing\n",
      "her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\" interrupted Laurie\n",
      "in a defiant tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if you are the gentleman I think you.  I'm disappointed, but the\n",
      "girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\n",
      "for a time.  Where will you go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anywhere.  I don't care what becomes of me,\" and Laurie got up with a\n",
      "reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake.  Why\n",
      "not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\n",
      "through college.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!\" and Laurie walked fast through the\n",
      "room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't ask you to go alone.  There's someone ready and glad to go\n",
      "with you, anywhere in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who, Sir?\" stopping to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying\n",
      "huskily, \"I'm a selfish brute, but—you know—Grandfather—\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before,\n",
      "once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy,\n",
      "just sit quietly down and hear my plan.  It's all settled, and can be\n",
      "carried out at once,\" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man,\n",
      "as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir, what is it?\" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of\n",
      "interest in face or voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is business in London that needs looking after.  I meant you\n",
      "should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here\n",
      "will get on very well with Brooke to manage them.  My partners do\n",
      "almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my place, and\n",
      "can be off at any time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you hate traveling, Sir.  I can't ask it of you at your age,\"\n",
      "began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to\n",
      "go alone, if he went at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\n",
      "prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him\n",
      "that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices.  So,\n",
      "stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would\n",
      "leave behind him, he said stoutly, \"Bless your soul, I'm not\n",
      "superannuated yet.  I quite enjoy the idea.  It will do me good, and my\n",
      "old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as\n",
      "sitting in a chair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy,\n",
      "or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, \"I\n",
      "don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you'd feel\n",
      "happier than if I was left behind.  I don't intend to gad about with\n",
      "you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in\n",
      "my own way.  I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\n",
      "them.  Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you\n",
      "will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your\n",
      "heart's content.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the\n",
      "world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the\n",
      "old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken\n",
      "heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly\n",
      "appeared in the howling wilderness.  He sighed, and then said, in a\n",
      "spiritless tone, \"Just as you like, Sir.  It doesn't matter where I go\n",
      "or what I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It does to me, remember that, my lad.  I give you entire liberty, but\n",
      "I trust you to make an honest use of it.  Promise me that, Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything you like, Sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good,\" thought the old gentleman.  \"You don't care now, but there'll\n",
      "come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm\n",
      "much mistaken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was\n",
      "hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,\n",
      "they were off.  During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore\n",
      "himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases.  He was moody,\n",
      "irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress\n",
      "and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided\n",
      "Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a\n",
      "tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a\n",
      "heavy sense of guilt by day.  Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of\n",
      "his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\n",
      "attempt consolation or offer sympathy.  On some accounts, this was a\n",
      "relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very\n",
      "uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the 'poor, dear fellow was\n",
      "going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy'.  Of course, he\n",
      "smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad\n",
      "superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was\n",
      "unalterable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain\n",
      "inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves.  This\n",
      "gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did\n",
      "for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with\n",
      "a whisper full of motherly solicitude.  Then feeling that he was going\n",
      "very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the\n",
      "afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life.  Jo followed a\n",
      "minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round.  He did look\n",
      "round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above\n",
      "him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal\n",
      "eloquent and pathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Jo, can't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all, except a little pause.  Then Laurie straightened himself\n",
      "up, said, \"It's all right, never mind,\" and went away without another\n",
      "word.  Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo did mind, for while the\n",
      "curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as\n",
      "if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left her without a\n",
      "look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in\n",
      "Beth.  No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\n",
      "gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by\n",
      "absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she\n",
      "saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in\n",
      "the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if\n",
      "the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining\n",
      "through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.  Jo saw\n",
      "and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first\n",
      "impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one\n",
      "appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo\n",
      "for a time forgot her fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety\n",
      "returned and haunted her.  She had confessed her sins and been\n",
      "forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip,\n",
      "Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from\n",
      "home.  Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and\n",
      "as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took\n",
      "Beth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open\n",
      "air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale\n",
      "cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people\n",
      "there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.\n",
      "Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care\n",
      "for anyone else.  So they were all in all to each other, and came and\n",
      "went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about\n",
      "them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the\n",
      "feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long\n",
      "separation was not far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves\n",
      "and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is\n",
      "very hard to overcome.  Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her\n",
      "heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there\n",
      "seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to\n",
      "speak.  She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not\n",
      "seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows\n",
      "grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home,\n",
      "believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She\n",
      "wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and\n",
      "what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when\n",
      "she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds\n",
      "blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Beth told her.  Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still,\n",
      "and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying\n",
      "to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks.  But she\n",
      "could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin,\n",
      "and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells\n",
      "they had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever\n",
      "that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively\n",
      "tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a\n",
      "minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth\n",
      "was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for\n",
      "her to say, \"Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it.  I've tried to tell you,\n",
      "but I couldn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even\n",
      "tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry.  She was the weaker\n",
      "then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about\n",
      "her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to it, it isn't\n",
      "hard to think of or to bear.  Try to see it so and don't be troubled\n",
      "about me, because it's best, indeed it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel\n",
      "it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?\" asked Jo, refusing\n",
      "to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no\n",
      "part in Beth's trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to\n",
      "think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone.  But\n",
      "when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was\n",
      "hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,\n",
      "Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you?\n",
      "How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of\n",
      "the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say\n",
      "goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.  I wasn't sure, no one\n",
      "said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken.  It would have been selfish\n",
      "to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away,\n",
      "and you so happy with Laurie—at least I thought so then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I\n",
      "couldn't,\" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,\n",
      "and added softly, \"Then you didn't, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and\n",
      "imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\" asked Beth, as\n",
      "innocently as a child.  \"I do love him dearly.  He is so good to me,\n",
      "how can I help It?  But he could never be anything to me but my\n",
      "brother.  I hope he truly will be, sometime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not through me,\" said Jo decidedly.  \"Amy is left for him, and they\n",
      "would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now.  I\n",
      "don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to, oh, so much!  I try, but every day I lose a little, and\n",
      "feel more sure that I shall never gain it back.  It's like the tide,\n",
      "Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too\n",
      "young, Beth.  I can't let you go.  I'll work and pray and fight against\n",
      "it.  I'll keep you in spite of everything.  There must be ways, it\n",
      "can't be too late.  God won't be so cruel as to take you from me,\"\n",
      "cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously\n",
      "submissive than Beth's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.  It shows\n",
      "itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than\n",
      "homilies or protestations.  Beth could not reason upon or explain the\n",
      "faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and\n",
      "cheerfully wait for death.  Like a confiding child, she asked no\n",
      "questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of\n",
      "us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and\n",
      "strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come.  She\n",
      "did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her\n",
      "passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love,\n",
      "from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He\n",
      "draws us closer to Himself.  She could not say, \"I'm glad to go,\" for\n",
      "life was very sweet for her.  She could only sob out, \"I try to be\n",
      "willing,\" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this\n",
      "great sorrow broke over them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, \"You'll tell them this\n",
      "when we go home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think they will see it without words,\" sighed Jo, for now it seemed\n",
      "to her that Beth changed every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps not.  I've heard that the people who love best are often\n",
      "blindest to such things.  If they don't see it, you will tell them for\n",
      "me.  I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them.  Meg\n",
      "has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father\n",
      "and Mother, won't you Jo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I can.  But, Beth, I don't give up yet.  I'm going to believe that\n",
      "it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true.\" said Jo, trying\n",
      "to speak cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, \"I don't\n",
      "know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but you,\n",
      "because I can't speak out except to my Jo.  I only mean to say that I\n",
      "have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long.  I'm not\n",
      "like the rest of you.  I never made any plans about what I'd do when I\n",
      "grew up.  I never thought of being married, as you all did.  I couldn't\n",
      "seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about\n",
      "at home, of no use anywhere but there.  I never wanted to go away, and\n",
      "the hard part now is the leaving you all.  I'm not afraid, but it seems\n",
      "as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the\n",
      "sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.  A white-winged gull flew\n",
      "by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast.  Beth watched it\n",
      "till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness.  A little\n",
      "gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach 'peeping' softly to\n",
      "itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea.  It came quite close to Beth,\n",
      "and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone,\n",
      "dressing its wet feathers, quite at home.  Beth smiled and felt\n",
      "comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and\n",
      "remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear little bird!  See, Jo, how tame it is.  I like peeps better than\n",
      "the gulls.  They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy,\n",
      "confiding little things.  I used to call them my birds last summer, and\n",
      "Mother said they reminded her of me—busy, quaker-colored creatures,\n",
      "always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song\n",
      "of theirs.  You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm\n",
      "and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.  Meg is the\n",
      "turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up\n",
      "among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again.  Dear\n",
      "little girl!  She's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and\n",
      "no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home.  I hope I\n",
      "shall see her again, but she seems so far away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to\n",
      "see and enjoy her.  I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time,\"\n",
      "began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change\n",
      "was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought\n",
      "aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, dear, don't hope any more.  It won't do any good.  I'm sure of\n",
      "that.  We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait.\n",
      "We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide\n",
      "will go out easily, if you help me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss,\n",
      "she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was right.  There was no need of any words when they got home, for\n",
      "Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from\n",
      "seeing.  Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying\n",
      "how glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she\n",
      "would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret.  Her father\n",
      "stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came\n",
      "in, but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went\n",
      "to comfort her without a word.\n",

      "At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice\n",
      "may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais—a charming place, for the\n",
      "wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is\n",
      "bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined\n",
      "with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills.\n",
      "Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes\n",
      "worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a\n",
      "carnival.  Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome\n",
      "Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all\n",
      "drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing\n",
      "the latest celebrity who has arrived—Ristori or Dickens, Victor\n",
      "Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.  The equipages are as\n",
      "varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low\n",
      "basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of\n",
      "dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from\n",
      "overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch\n",
      "behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with\n",
      "his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.\n",
      "He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the\n",
      "independent air of an American—a combination which caused sundry pairs\n",
      "of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in\n",
      "black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange\n",
      "flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy\n",
      "him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the\n",
      "young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at\n",
      "some blonde girl in blue.  Presently he strolled out of the promenade\n",
      "and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and\n",
      "listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach\n",
      "toward Castle Hill.  The quick trot of ponies' feet made him look up,\n",
      "as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came\n",
      "rapidly down the street.  The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in\n",
      "blue.  He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up, and, waving his\n",
      "hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Laurie, is it really you?  I thought you'd never come!\" cried Amy,\n",
      "dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great\n",

      "'mad English'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,\n",

      "\"How is your grandfather?  When did you come?  Where are you staying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well—last night—at the Chauvain.  I called at your hotel, but\n",
      "you were out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin!  Get in and we can\n",
      "talk at our ease.  I was going for a drive and longing for company.\n",
      "Flo's saving up for tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What happens then, a ball?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Christmas party at our hotel.  There are many Americans there, and\n",
      "they give it in honor of the day.  You'll go with us, of course?  Aunt\n",
      "will be charmed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  Where now?\" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his\n",
      "arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her\n",
      "parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs afforded her\n",
      "infinite satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill.\n",
      "The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\n",
      "been there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now tell me all about yourself.  The last I heard of you, your\n",
      "grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has\n",
      "settled for the winter.  He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse\n",
      "him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a sociable arrangement,\" said Amy, missing something in\n",
      "Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each\n",
      "suit ourselves, and there is no trouble.  I am often with him, and he\n",
      "enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see\n",
      "me when I get back from my wanderings.  Dirty old hole, isn't it?\" he\n",
      "added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the\n",
      "Place Napoleon in the old city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind.  The river and the hills are\n",
      "delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my\n",
      "delight.  Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass.  It's\n",
      "going to the Church of St.  John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\n",
      "canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some\n",
      "brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt\n",
      "a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could\n",
      "not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside\n",
      "her.  He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but\n",
      "now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired\n",
      "and spiritless—not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver\n",
      "than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him.  She\n",
      "couldn't understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she\n",
      "shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away\n",
      "across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Que pensez-vous?\" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\n",
      "quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\n",
      "charming,\" replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an\n",
      "admiring look.\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\n",
      "her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\n",
      "promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\n",
      "'altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\n",
      "head.  She didn't like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded\n",
      "indifferent in spite of the look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,\" she\n",
      "thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\n",
      "meantime to seem quite easy and gay.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins\n",
      "to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road\n",
      "between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\n",
      "\n",

      "in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\n",
      "of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed\n",

      "which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her\n",
      "cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure\n",
      "in the pleasant scene.\n",

      "and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\n",
      "find favor in his sight.  Amy knew her good points, and made the most\n",

      "flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\n",
      "both inexpensive and effective.  It must be confessed that the artist\n",

      "covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white\n",
      "shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair\n",

      "surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\n",
      "chasseed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\n",
      "real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\n",
      "had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\" she said,\n",

      "\n",
      "In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\n",

      "thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\n",
      "than the sportive or piquante.  She walked up and down the long saloon\n",
      "while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\n",
      "chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought\n",
      "better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\n",
      "of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one.  It so\n",
      "happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came\n",
      "in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant\n",
      "window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress,\n",

      "a well-placed statue.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here are your flowers.  I arranged them myself, remembering that you\n",

      "A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk\n",
      "with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with\n",

      "German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely\n",
      "about, seeking what he might devour.  Baron Rothschild's private\n",
      "secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\n",
      "world, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo.  A stout\n",
      "Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\n",
      "and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\n",
      "family of eight.  Of course, there were many light-footed,\n",

      "she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a\n",
      "ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when\n",
      "young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to\n",
      "rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.  She did pity the Davis\n",
      "girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim\n",
      "papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her\n",
      "friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it\n",
      "permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who\n",
      "her distinguished-looking friend might be.  With the first burst of the\n",
      "band, Amy's color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap\n",
      "the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know\n",
      "it.  Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than\n",
      "described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, \"Do you care to\n",
      "dance?\"\n",

      "\"One usually does at a ball.\"\n",

      "trifled with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...\n",

      "\n",
      "was all the satisfaction she got, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\n",
      "was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the\n",
      "while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish.  Laurie\n",
      "resigned her to the 'nice little boy', and went to do his duty to Flo,\n",
      "without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\n",
      "forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\n",
      "till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She\n",
      "showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled\n",
      "instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka\n",
      "redowa.  But his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when she\n",
      "galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with\n",
      "an actual expression of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\n",
      "while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between\n",
      "the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest.  Her anger had a\n",
      "good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed\n",
      "unusually blithe and brilliant.  Laurie's eyes followed her with\n",
      "pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\n",
      "and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.  He very\n",
      "naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before\n",
      "the evening was half over, had decided that 'little Amy was going to\n",
      "make a very charming woman'.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\n",
      "possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\n",
      "hearts happy, and heels light.  The musicians fiddled, tooted, and\n",
      "banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who\n",
      "couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth.  The air was\n",
      "dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young\n",
      "giraffes.  The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor\n",
      "with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin\n",
      "train.  The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating\n",
      "steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the\n",
      "ravages he committed.  But the Emperor's friend covered himself with\n",
      "glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and\n",
      "introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him.  The\n",
      "boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he\n",
      "'carried weight', he danced like an India-rubber ball.  He ran, he\n",
      "flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails\n",
      "waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the\n",
      "music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his\n",
      "fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more\n",
      "graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time\n",
      "to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as\n",
      "indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished\n",
      "her, with assurances that he was 'desolated to leave so early', she was\n",
      "ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections\n",
      "find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young\n",
      "blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the\n",
      "enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.  Laurie had a waked-up\n",
      "look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring\n",
      "her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, \"Ah, I\n",

      "outright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call this stuff?\" he asked, touching a fold of her dress\n",

      "\"Good name for it.  It's very pretty—new thing, isn't it?\"\n",

      "Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd\n",
      "sort of pleasure in having 'little Amy' order him about, for she had\n",
      "lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him,\n",
      "as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any\n",
      "signs of subjection.\n",

      "\"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?\" he asked with a quizzical\n",
      "look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly\n",
      "explain?\" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but\n",
      "wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well—the general air, the style, the self-possession,\n",

      "opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.\n",
      "Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up\n",
      "her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of\n",
      "the evening in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought\n",

      "their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually\n",
      "abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion\n",
      "almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet.\n",
      "Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as\n",

      "\n",
      "Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\n",

      "course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as\n",
      "they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they\n",
      "wanted.  Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not\n",
      "so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by\n",
      "an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi\n",
      "inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness of character, we won't call\n",
      "it obstinacy, and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\n",
      "anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change\n",
      "that pertinacious little mind.  Mamma thought the dear too young to be\n",
      "taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was\n",
      "too soon to learn obedience.  So Master Demi early discovered that when\n",
      "he undertook to 'wrastle' with 'Parpar', he always got the worst of it,\n",
      "yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and\n",

      "that nothing should interfere with her experiment.  But unfortunately\n",
      "Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that\n",
      "night he decided to go on a rampage.  So poor Meg sang and rocked, told\n",
      "stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all\n",
      "in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long after Daisy had gone to\n",
      "byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty\n",

      "expression of countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives\n",
      "poor Papa his tea?\" asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the\n",
      "well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me has tea!\" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go\n",
      "bye-bye like Daisy.  Will you, lovey?\"\n",

      "desired day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran\n",
      "down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow\n",
      "in her hair which was his especial admiration.  He saw it at once and\n",
      "said with pleased surprise, \"Why, little mother, how gay we are\n",
      "tonight.  Do you expect company?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change.  You always\n",

      "shouldn't I when I have the time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do it out of respect for you, my dear,\" said old-fashioned John.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,\" laughed Meg, looking young and pretty\n",
      "again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times.  This tastes\n",
      "right.  I drink your health, dear.\" and John sipped his tea with an air\n",
      "of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as\n",
      "he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little\n",
      "voice was heard, saying impatiently...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Opy doy.  Me's tummin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's that naughty boy.  I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he\n",

      "said Meg, answering the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mornin' now,\" announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his\n",
      "long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing\n",
      "gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the 'cakies' with loving\n",
      "glances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it isn't morning yet.  You must go to bed, and not trouble poor\n",
      "Mamma.  Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me loves Parpar,\" said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal\n",
      "knee and revel in forbidden joys.  But John shook his head, and said to\n",
      "Meg...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do\n",
      "it, or he will never learn to mind you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course.  Come, Demi,\"  and Meg led her son away, feeling a\n",
      "strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,\n",
      "laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as\n",
      "soon as they reached the nursery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him\n",
      "a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more\n",
      "promenades till morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Iss!\" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and\n",
      "regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when\n",
      "the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies\n",
      "by boldly demanding, \"More sudar, Marmar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now this won't do,\" said John, hardening his heart against the\n",
      "engaging little sinner.  \"We shall never know any peace till that child\n",
      "learns to go to bed properly.  You have made a slave of yourself long\n",
      "enough.  Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it.  Put\n",
      "him in his bed and leave him, Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.\"\n",

      "bids you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"S'ant!\" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted\n",
      "'cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must never say that to Papa.  I shall carry you if you don't go\n",
      "yourself.\"\n",

      "\"Go 'way, me don't love Parpar.\" and Demi retired to his mother's\n",
      "skirts for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to\n",
      "the enemy, with a \"Be gentle with him, John,\" which struck the culprit\n",
      "with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at\n",
      "hand.  Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a\n",
      "strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his\n",
      "wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the\n",
      "way upstairs.  The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled\n",
      "out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously\n",
      "caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which\n",
      "lively performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out,\n",
      "when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice.  This vocal\n",
      "exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post\n",
      "which is popularly believed to be deaf.  No coaxing, no sugar, no\n",
      "lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of\n",
      "the fire enlivened the 'big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity\n",
      "rather than fear.  This new order of things disgusted him, and he\n",
      "howled dismally for 'Marmar', as his angry passions subsided, and\n",
      "recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.\n",
      "The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's\n",
      "heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear.  I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and\n",
      "he must, if I stay here all night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he'll cry himself sick,\" pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for\n",
      "deserting her boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter\n",
      "is settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind.  Don't\n",
      "interfere, I'll manage him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by indulgence.  Go\n",
      "down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.\"\n",

      "\"Please let me kiss him once, John?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly.  Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest,\n",
      "for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it\n",
      "was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom\n",
      "of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying.  I'll cover him\n",
      "up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest,\" thought John, creeping to\n",
      "the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes\n",
      "opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying\n",
      "with a penitent hiccough, \"Me's dood, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which\n",
      "followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible\n",
      "accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest.  Demi\n",
      "lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a\n",
      "subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and\n",
      "holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered\n",
      "with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.  So held,\n",
      "John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed\n",
      "its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that\n",
      "tussle with his son than with his whole day's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to\n",
      "herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, \"I\n",
      "never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies.  He does\n",
      "know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting\n",
      "too much for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful\n",
      "wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a\n",
      "bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the\n",
      "election, if he was not too tired.  John saw in a minute that a\n",
      "revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,\n",
      "knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't\n",
      "keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon\n",
      "appear.  He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then\n",
      "explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply\n",
      "interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from\n",
      "wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.  In\n",
      "her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as\n",
      "mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling\n",
      "each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and\n",
      "when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought\n",
      "diplomatic ambiguity, \"Well, I really don't see what we are coming to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty\n",
      "little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it\n",
      "with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like\n",
      "millinery for hers, that's only fair,\" thought John the Just, adding\n",
      "aloud, \"That's very pretty.  Is it what you call a breakfast cap?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear man, it's a bonnet!   My very best go-to-concert-and-theater\n",
      "bonnet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of\n",
      "the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,\"\n",
      "and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an\n",
      "air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks\n",
      "young and happy again,\" and John kissed the smiling face, to the great\n",
      "detriment of the rosebud under the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new\n",
      "concerts some night.  I really need some music to put me in tune.  Will\n",
      "you, please?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.  You\n",
      "have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall\n",
      "enjoy it, of all things.  What put it into your head, little mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous\n",
      "and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and\n",
      "less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to\n",
      "things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just\n",
      "to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before\n",
      "my time.  It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your\n",
      "sake as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately,\n",
      "and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can.  You don't\n",
      "object, I hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little\n",
      "bonnet had from utter ruin.  All that we have any business to know is\n",
      "that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which\n",
      "gradually took place in the house and its inmates.  It was not all\n",
      "Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of\n",
      "labor system.  The children throve under the paternal rule, for\n",
      "accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while\n",
      "Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of\n",
      "wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential\n",
      "conversation with her sensible husband.  Home grew homelike again, and\n",
      "John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him.  The Scotts\n",
      "came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house a\n",
      "cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love.  Even\n",
      "Sallie Moffatt liked to go there.  \"It is always so quiet and pleasant\n",
      "here, it does me good, Meg,\" she used to say, looking about her with\n",
      "wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it\n",
      "in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no\n",
      "riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own,\n",
      "where there was no place for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had\n",
      "found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to\n",
      "use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual\n",
      "helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.\n",
      "This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent\n",
      "to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding\n",
      "loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,\n",
      "undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through\n",
      "fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true\n",
      "sense of the good old Saxon word, the 'house-band', and learning, as\n",
      "Meg learned, that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor\n",
      "the art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month.  He\n",
      "was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed\n",
      "to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a\n",
      "part.  He rather missed the 'petting' he used to receive, and enjoyed a\n",
      "taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from\n",
      "strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls\n",
      "at home.  Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very\n",
      "glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the\n",
      "representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she\n",
      "would confess.  They naturally took comfort in each other's society and\n",
      "were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice\n",
      "no one can be very industrious during the gay season.  But, while\n",
      "apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were\n",
      "half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each\n",
      "other.  Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in\n",
      "hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.  Amy tried to\n",
      "please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he\n",
      "gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly\n",
      "women know how to lend an indescribable charm.  Laurie made no effort\n",
      "of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as\n",
      "possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind\n",
      "word because one had been cold to him.  It cost him no effort to be\n",
      "generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she\n",
      "would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not\n",
      "change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the\n",
      "keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful,\n",
      "half-scornful surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.  I preferred to stay at\n",
      "home and write letters.  They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa\n",
      "to sketch, will you come?\" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely\n",
      "day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?\" he answered\n",
      "slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.\n",

      "\"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so\n",
      "you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves\n",

      "which were a weak point with Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll go with pleasure.\" and he put out his hand for her\n",
      "sketchbook.  But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't trouble yourself.  It's no exertion to me, but you don't look\n",
      "equal to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran\n",
      "downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins\n",
      "himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and\n",
      "fall asleep on his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two never quarreled.  Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie\n",
      "was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an\n",
      "inquiring air.  She answered him with a smile, and they went on\n",
      "together in the most amicable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque\n",
      "scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.  Here an ancient monastery,\n",
      "whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them.  There a\n",
      "bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\n",
      "over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among\n",
      "the rocks or lay at his feet.  Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\n",
      "panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a\n",
      "capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with\n",
      "a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\n",
      "quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\n",
      "the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky\n",
      "foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\n",
      "fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\n",
      "Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer\n",
      "roses blossomed everywhere.  They overhung the archway, thrust\n",
      "themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\n",
      "passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and\n",
      "feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\n",
      "seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool\n",
      "grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every\n",
      "fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\n",
      "smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\n",
      "the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\n",
      "the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,\n",
      "and the white-walled city on its shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it?  Did you ever see such\n",
      "roses?\" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\n",
      "luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, nor felt such thorns,\" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\n",
      "mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\n",
      "grew just beyond his reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\" said Amy,\n",
      "gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\n",
      "behind her.  She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he\n",
      "stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\n",
      "the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\n",
      "he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\n",
      "when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for\n",
      "romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\n",
      "red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones\n",
      "like that from the greenhouse at home.  The pale roses Amy gave him\n",
      "were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal\n",
      "wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for\n",
      "himself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better\n",
      "of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard\n",
      "since he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,\" she\n",
      "said, thinking her speech amused him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I will,\" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\n",
      "it in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\" she asked presently,\n",
      "as she settled herself on a rustic seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say, short answers save trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He expects you, and you really ought to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hospitable creature!  I know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why don't you do it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Natural depravity, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Natural indolence, you mean.  It's really dreadful!\" and Amy looked\n",
      "severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\n",
      "might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\n",
      "better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,\" and Laurie\n",
      "composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of\n",
      "resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture 'that boy' and in\n",
      "a minute she began again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing just now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watching lizards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no.  I mean what do you intend and wish to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How provoking you are!  I don't approve of cigars and I will only\n",
      "allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.  I need a\n",
      "figure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all the pleasure in life.  How will you have me, full length or\n",
      "three-quarters, on my head or my heels?  I should respectfully suggest\n",
      "a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call it 'Dolce far\n",
      "niente'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.  I intend to work hard,\"\n",
      "said Amy in her most energetic tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What delightful enthusiasm!\" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\n",
      "air of entire satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would Jo say if she saw you now?\" asked Amy impatiently, hoping\n",
      "to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy.  I'm busy!'\" He laughed as he spoke, but\n",
      "the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\n",
      "utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\n",
      "yet.  Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\n",
      "before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\n",
      "Laurie's face—a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\n",
      "regret.  It was gone before she could study it and the listless\n",
      "expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\n",
      "pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\n",
      "the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for\n",
      "he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\" she\n",
      "said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wish I was!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so\n",
      "changed, I sometimes think—\" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\n",
      "half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\n",
      "to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used\n",
      "to say it to her mother, \"It's all right, ma'am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\n",
      "her lately.  It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\n",
      "cordial tone in which she said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of that!  I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I\n",
      "fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\n",
      "your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into\n",
      "some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of\n",
      "a foreign tour.  Don't stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the\n",
      "grass here and 'let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when we got in\n",
      "the sofa corner and told secrets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\n",
      "himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm all ready for the secrets.\" and he glanced up with a decided\n",
      "expression of interest in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've none to tell.  You may begin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haven't one to bless myself with.  I thought perhaps you'd had some\n",
      "news from home..\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have heard all that has come lately.  Don't you hear often?  I\n",
      "fancied Jo would send you volumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's very busy.  I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,\n",
      "you know.  When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\" he\n",
      "asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\n",
      "had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never,\" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \"Rome took\n",
      "all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt\n",
      "too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy\n",
      "can make it so.  I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a\n",
      "common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get\n",
      "the chance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity\n",
      "becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation.  Laurie\n",
      "smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose\n",
      "when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!  And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\n",
      "downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, \"Now I'm going\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't promise to answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your face will, if your tongue won't.  You aren't woman of the world\n",
      "enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.  I heard rumors about Fred\n",
      "and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if he had not been\n",
      "called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\n",
      "of it, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not for me to say,\" was Amy's grim reply, but her lips would\n",

      "that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\n",
      "\n",

      "fancied you'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\" began Amy,\n",
      "trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of\n",
      "herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand.  Queens of society can't get on without money, so you\n",
      "mean to make a good match, and start in that way?  Quite right and\n",
      "proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of\n",
      "your mother's girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True, nevertheless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\n",
      "contrasted curiously with the young speaker.  Laurie felt this\n",
      "instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of\n",
      "disappointment which he could not explain.  His look and silence, as\n",
      "well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her\n",
      "resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\" she said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I could, if I tried.\" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\n",
      "the most summary style.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try, then.  I give you leave,\" returned Laurie, who enjoyed having\n",
      "someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd be angry in five minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm never angry with you.  It takes two flints to make a fire. You are\n",
      "as cool and soft as snow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know what I can do.  Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if\n",
      "applied rightly.  Your indifference is half affectation, and a good\n",
      "stirring up would prove it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said\n",
      "when his little wife beat him.  Regard me in the light of a husband or\n",
      "a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees\n",
      "with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the\n",
      "apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and\n",
      "began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Flo and I have got a new name for you.  It's Lazy Laurence. How do you\n",
      "like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his\n",
      "head, with an imperturbable, \"That's not bad. Thank you, ladies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pining to be told.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I despise you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had even said 'I hate you' in a petulant or coquettish tone, he\n",
      "would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad,\n",
      "accent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, if you please?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are\n",
      "faulty, lazy, and miserable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strong language, mademoiselle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you like it, I'll go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray do, it's quite interesting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd find it so.  Selfish people always like to talk about\n",
      "themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I selfish?\" the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of\n",
      "surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very selfish,\" continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as\n",
      "effective just then as an angry one.  \"I'll show you how, for I've\n",
      "studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied with\n",
      "you.  Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but\n",
      "waste time and money and disappoint your friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't look as if you'd had much.  At any rate, you are none the\n",
      "better for it, as far as I can see.  I said when we first met that you\n",
      "had improved.  Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so\n",
      "nice as when I left you at home.  You have grown abominably lazy, you\n",
      "like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to\n",
      "be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and\n",
      "respected by wise ones.  With money, talent, position, health, and\n",
      "beauty, ah you like that old Vanity!  But it's the truth, so I can't\n",
      "help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you\n",
      "can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you\n",
      "ought to be, you are only...\"  there she stopped, with a look that had\n",
      "both pain and pity in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Saint Laurence on a gridiron,\" added Laurie, blandly finishing the\n",
      "sentence.  But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a\n",
      "wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured\n",
      "expression replaced the former indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I supposed you'd take it so.  You men tell us we are angels, and say\n",
      "we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you\n",
      "good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how much your\n",
      "flattery is worth.\" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the\n",
      "exasperating martyr at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,\n",
      "and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, \"I\n",
      "will be good, oh, I will be good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the\n",
      "outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, \"Aren't you ashamed of a\n",
      "hand like that?  It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if\n",
      "it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers\n",
      "for ladies.  You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see\n",
      "there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one\n",
      "Jo gave you so long ago.  Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough\n",
      "in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.  She glanced down at him with\n",
      "a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his\n",
      "face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth.  She only saw\n",
      "his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a\n",
      "sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as\n",
      "if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in\n",
      "a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in\n",
      "Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her.\n",
      "She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled\n",
      "the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the\n",
      "wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome\n",
      "hand.  Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.\n",
      "Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the\n",
      "alteration, and now she was sure of it.  Her keen eyes filled, and when\n",
      "she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and\n",
      "kind when she chose to make it so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren't\n",
      "the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.\n",
      "But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they\n",
      "should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps\n",
      "they would understand the change better than I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think they would,\" came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as\n",
      "touching as a broken one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,\n",
      "when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.  I never did\n",
      "like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!\" said artful Amy, wishing to\n",
      "be sure of her facts this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang Miss Randal!\" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look\n",
      "that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg pardon, I thought...\" and there she paused diplomatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but\n",
      "Jo,\" Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face\n",
      "away as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came\n",
      "away, I supposed I was mistaken.  And Jo wouldn't be kind to you?  Why,\n",
      "I was sure she loved you dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her she\n",
      "didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me.  It's\n",
      "her fault though, and you may tell her so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled\n",
      "Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was wrong, I didn't know.  I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I\n",
      "can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't, that's her name for me!\" and Laurie put up his hand with a\n",
      "quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,\n",
      "half-reproachful tone.  \"Wait till you've tried it yourself,\" he added\n",
      "in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,\" said\n",
      "Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well,\n",
      "making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live\n",
      "it down alone.  Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for\n",
      "the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first\n",
      "failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference.  He felt as if\n",
      "suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to\n",
      "sleep again.  Presently he sat up and asked slowly, \"Do you think Jo\n",
      "would despise me as you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if she saw you now.  She hates lazy people.  Why don't you do\n",
      "something splendid, and make her love you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did my best, but it was no use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Graduating well, you mean?  That was no more than you ought to have\n",
      "done, for your grandfather's sake.  It would have been shameful to fail\n",
      "after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you\n",
      "could do well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,\" began Laurie,\n",
      "leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and\n",
      "proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set\n",
      "about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self\n",
      "again, and forget your trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's impossible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try it and see.  You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much\n",
      "she knows about such things'.  I don't pretend to be wise, but I am\n",
      "observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine.  I'm\n",
      "interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and\n",
      "though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.\n",
      "Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for\n",
      "it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the\n",
      "one you want.  There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake\n",
      "up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither spoke for several minutes.  Laurie sat turning the little ring\n",
      "on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had\n",
      "been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,\n",
      "merely saying, \"How do you like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it\n",
      "was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless\n",
      "face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the\n",
      "little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How well you draw!\" he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at\n",
      "her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, \"Yes, that's me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you are.  This is as you were.\" and Amy laid another sketch beside\n",
      "the one he held.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\n",
      "which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that\n",
      "a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked.  Only a\n",
      "rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.  Hat and coat were off, and\n",
      "every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude\n",
      "was full of energy and meaning.  The handsome brute, just subdued,\n",
      "stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot\n",
      "impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for\n",
      "the voice that had mastered him.  In the ruffled mane, the rider's\n",
      "breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly\n",
      "arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that\n",
      "contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the 'Dolce far Niente'\n",
      "sketch.  Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other,\n",
      "Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and\n",
      "accepted the little lesson she had given him.  That satisfied her, and\n",
      "without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all\n",
      "looked on?  Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced,\n",
      "and I sat on the fence and drew you.  I found that sketch in my\n",
      "portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged.  You've improved immensely since then, and I\n",
      "congratulate you.  May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon paradise'\n",
      "that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow\n",
      "and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures\n",
      "should have an end.  He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent\n",
      "air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more\n",
      "effacious than he would confess.  Amy felt the shade of coldness in his\n",
      "manner, and said to herself...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I've offended him.  Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if it\n",
      "makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take back a\n",
      "word of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up\n",
      "behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming\n",
      "spirits.  But both felt ill at ease.  The friendly frankness was\n",
      "disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their\n",
      "apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?\" asked Amy, as they parted\n",
      "at her aunt's door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfortunately I have an engagement.  Au revoir, madamoiselle,\" and\n",
      "Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which\n",
      "became him better than many men.  Something in his face made Amy say\n",
      "quickly and warmly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd\n",
      "rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental\n",
      "salutations in France.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodbye, dear,\" and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,\n",
      "Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made\n",
      "her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within\n",
      "yourself, for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of\n",
      "boys.  A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful\n",
      "honeymoon at Valrosa!  I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser.\n",
      "Tell him so, with my congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yours gratefully, Telemachus\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good boy!  I'm glad he's gone,\" said Amy, with an approving smile. The\n",
      "next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,\n",
      "with an involuntary sigh, \"Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,\n",
      "and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased\n",
      "affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of\n",
      "trouble.  They put away their grief, and each did his or her part\n",
      "toward making that last year a happy one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\n",
      "gathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano,\n",
      "the little worktable, and the beloved pussies.  Father's best books\n",
      "found their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest\n",
      "sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\n",
      "to make sunshine for Aunty Beth.  John quietly set apart a little sum,\n",
      "that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\n",
      "the fruit she loved and longed for.  Old Hannah never wearied of\n",
      "concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\n",
      "as she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\n",
      "letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\n",
      "that know no winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,\n",
      "tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,\n",
      "unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to\n",
      "make it happier for those who should remain behind.  The feeble fingers\n",
      "were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for\n",

      "\n",
      "Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\n",
      "Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was\n",
      "the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't\n",
      "she—and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he\n",
      "did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of\n",
      "impatience.  It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one\n",
      "point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.  She was wrapped up in\n",
      "Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again.  Then she begged\n",
      "him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of\n",
      "his heart for his loving sister Jo.  In a postscript she desired him\n",
      "not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring\n",
      "and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay.  That\n",

      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his\n",

      "Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and\n",
      "business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and\n",
      "in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up\n",
      "with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead\n",
      "roses put away inside.  With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,\n",
      "Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them\n",
      "neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring\n",
      "thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the\n",
      "letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint\n",
      "Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not\n",
      "overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the\n",

      "The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\n",
      "was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\n",
      "manner.  The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to\n",
      "and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.  Laurie\n",
      "sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,\n",
      "hoping somebody would arrive before long.  He wanted desperately to go\n",
      "to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him,\n",
      "for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made\n",

      "decided to answer, \"Yes, thank you,\" but now she said, \"No, thank you,\"\n",
      "kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,\n",
      "and she found that something more than money and position was needed to\n",
      "satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes\n",
      "and fears.  The words, \"Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I\n",
      "fancied you would ever like,\" and Laurie's face when he uttered them,\n",
      "kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in\n",
      "look, if not in words, \"I shall marry for money.\"  It troubled her to\n",
      "remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so\n",
      "unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless,  worldly\n",
      "creature.  She didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as\n",
      "she did to be a lovable woman.  She was so glad he didn't hate her for\n",
      "the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was\n",
      "kinder than ever.  His letters were such a comfort, for the home\n",
      "letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when\n",
      "they did come.  It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,\n",
      "for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted\n",
      "in being stonyhearted.  She ought to have made an effort and tried to\n",
      "love him.  It couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and\n",
      "glad to have such a dear boy care for them.  But Jo never would act\n",
      "like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat\n",

      "\n",
      "If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they\n",
      "would be a much happier race of beings than they are.  Amy never\n",

      "interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him,\n",

      "confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.\n",
      "As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about\n",
      "in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when\n",
      "short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that\n",
      "Amy did any of these fond and foolish things.  But she certainly did\n",
      "grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for\n",
      "society, and went out sketching alone a good deal.  She never had much\n",
      "to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while\n",
      "she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or\n",
      "absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight\n",
      "carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over\n",
      "his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a\n",
      "ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur\n",
      "according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether\n",
      "satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding\n",
      "denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what\n",
      "she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to\n",
      "Egypt.  That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he\n",

      "\n",
      "With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his\n",

      "at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from\n",
      "Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of\n",
      "Genoa and the Italian lakes.  She bore it very well, and quietly\n",
      "submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit,\n",
      "for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay,\n",
      "and let absence soften her sorrow.  But her heart was very heavy, she\n",

      "waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,\n",

      "he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow\n",
      "pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy\n",
      "and sorrow, hope and suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\n",
      "hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en\n",

      "take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be\n",
      "in the chateau garden.  If monsieur would give himself the pain of\n",
      "sitting down, a flash of time should present her.  But monsieur could\n",
      "not wait even a 'flash of time', and in the middle of the speech\n",
      "departed to find mademoiselle himself.\n",

      "A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts\n",

      "low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or\n",
      "console herself with the beauty all about her.  She was sitting here\n",
      "that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy\n",
      "eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.  She did\n",
      "not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the\n",
      "archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden.  He stood\n",
      "a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\n",
      "before, the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely\n",
      "suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black\n",
      "ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her\n",
      "face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to\n",
      "Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only\n",
      "ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him,\n",
      "they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for\n",
      "dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood\n",
      "together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\n",
      "protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\n",
      "sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\n",
      "woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him happy.  He\n",
      "did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the\n",

      "\n",
      "In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears,\n",
      "Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\n",
      "well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.\n",
      "As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at\n",
      "the recollection of her impulsive greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to\n",
      "see you.  It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was\n",
      "beginning to fear you wouldn't come,\" she said, trying in vain to speak\n",
      "quite naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I came the minute I heard.  I wish I could say something to comfort\n",
      "you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...\"  He\n",
      "could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden,\n",
      "and did not quite know what to say.  He longed to lay Amy's head down\n",
      "on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare,\n",
      "so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was\n",
      "better than words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't say anything, this comforts me,\" she said softly.  \"Beth\n",
      "is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, but I dread the going\n",
      "home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for\n",

      "while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that\n",
      "Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she\n",
      "wanted—the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she\n",
      "needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half sick!\n",
      "I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk\n",
      "about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,\" he said,\n",
      "in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied\n",
      "on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the\n",
      "sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.  He felt more at ease upon\n",
      "his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,\n",
      "a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully\n",
      "for her alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed\n",
      "expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but\n",
      "the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of\n",
      "their words, as it rippled by below.  For an hour this new pair walked\n",
      "and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which\n",
      "gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell\n",
      "warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and\n",
      "sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated\n",
      "with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, \"Now I understand it\n",
      "all—the child has been pining for young Laurence.  Bless my heart, I\n",
      "never thought of such a thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed\n",
      "no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged\n",
      "Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much\n",
      "solitude.  Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal\n",
      "occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it\n",
      "with more than her usual success.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.  At Vevay, Laurie was\n",
      "never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the\n",
      "most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed\n",
      "his example as far and as fast as she could.  He said the change was\n",
      "owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a\n",
      "like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked\n",
      "wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get\n",
      "clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.\n",
      "The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and\n",
      "moody mists.  The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of\n",
      "aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts.  The lake seemed to\n",
      "wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look\n",
      "benignly down upon them saying, \"Little children, love one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that\n",
      "Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.  It took him a little\n",
      "while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he\n",
      "had firmly believed, his last and only love.  He consoled himself for\n",
      "the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the\n",
      "same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been\n",
      "impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.  His\n",
      "first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon\n",
      "it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion\n",
      "blended with regret.  He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one\n",
      "of the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be\n",
      "grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should\n",
      "be as calm and simple as possible.  There was no need of having a\n",
      "scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it\n",
      "without words and had given him his answer long ago.  It all came about\n",
      "so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody\n",
      "would be pleased, even Jo.  But when our first little passion has been\n",
      "crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so\n",
      "Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance\n",
      "the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and\n",
      "sweetest part of his new romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the\n",
      "chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous\n",
      "manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was\n",
      "settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been\n",
      "floating about all the morning, from gloomy St.  Gingolf to sunny\n",
      "Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St.  Bernard and the\n",
      "Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne\n",
      "upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake\n",
      "below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged\n",
      "gulls.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of\n",
      "Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Heloise.\n",
      "Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each\n",
      "privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own.  Amy had\n",
      "been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell\n",
      "between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars\n",
      "with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for\n",
      "the sake of saying something...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must be tired.  Rest a little, and let me row.  It will do me\n",
      "good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.  There's room\n",
      "enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't\n",
      "trim,\" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered\n",
      "third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar.\n",
      "She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used\n",
      "both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went\n",
      "smoothly through the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How well we pull together, don't we?\" said Amy, who objected to\n",
      "silence just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,\n",
      "Amy?\" very tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Laurie,\" very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little\n",

      "in the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in\n",
      "another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example.  But when\n",
      "the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved\n",
      "presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo\n",
      "found her promise very hard to keep.  How could she 'comfort Father and\n",
      "Mother' when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her\n",
      "sister, how could she 'make the house cheerful' when all its light and\n",

      "useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the loving\n",
      "service which had been its own reward?  She tried in a blind, hopeless\n",
      "way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it\n",
      "seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made\n",
      "heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.  Some\n",
      "people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow.  It was not\n",
      "fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,\n",

      "\"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Glad!  My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your mother has got her down at Meg's.  We stopped there by the way,\n",
      "and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\n",
      "unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, the dickens!  Now I've done it,\" and he looked so guilty that Jo\n",
      "was down on him like a flash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've gone and got married!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, please, but I never will again,\" and he went down upon his knees,\n",
      "with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,\n",
      "and triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Actually married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very much so, thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on us.  What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into\n",
      "her seat with a gasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\"\n",
      "returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\n",
      "satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like\n",
      "a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you\n",
      "ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to\n",
      "barricade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted\n",
      "the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, \"The old pillow is\n",
      "up garret, and we don't need it now.  So, come and 'fess, Teddy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that\n",
      "but you,\" and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does Amy call you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's like her.  Well, you look it,\" and Jo's eye plainly betrayed\n",
      "that she found her boy comelier than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural\n",
      "one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart.  Both felt it, and\n",
      "for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a\n",
      "little shadow over them.  It was gone directly however, for Laurie\n",
      "said, with a vain attempt at dignity...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit, and you never will.  You've grown bigger and bonnier, but\n",
      "you are the same scapegrace as ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\n",
      "Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so\n",
      "irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!\" answered Jo, smiling all\n",
      "over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then\n",
      "settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all\n",
      "coming up presently.  I couldn't wait.  I wanted to be the one to tell\n",
      "you the grand surprise, and have 'first skim' as we used to say when we\n",
      "squabbled about the cream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong\n",
      "end.  Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I'm pining to\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\n",
      "Jo exclaim...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fib number one.  Amy did it to please you.  Go on, and tell the truth,\n",
      "if you can, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now she's beginning to marm it.  Isn't it jolly to hear her?\" said\n",
      "Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\n",
      "agreed.  \"It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned\n",
      "to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\n",
      "changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris.  But\n",
      "Grandpa wanted to come home.  He went to please me, and I couldn't let\n",
      "him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got\n",
      "English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy\n",
      "come with us.  So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be\n",
      "married, and then we can do as we like'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you did.  You always have things to suit you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not always,\" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\n",
      "of good reasons on our side.  There wasn't time to write and ask leave,\n",
      "but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only\n",
      "'taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?\"\n",
      "interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\n",
      "delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been\n",
      "so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I can't help\n",
      "being proud of her.  Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play\n",
      "propriety.  We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use\n",
      "apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all\n",
      "round, so we did it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When, where, how?\" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and\n",
      "curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very quiet\n",
      "wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear\n",
      "little Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the\n",
      "little red pillow, which he remembered well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you let us know afterward?\" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,\n",
      "when they had sat quite still a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We wanted to surprise you.  We thought we were coming directly home,\n",
      "at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found\n",
      "he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend\n",
      "our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular\n",
      "honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but\n",
      "once in their lives. My faith!  Wasn't it love among the roses!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the\n",
      "fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured\n",
      "her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away\n",
      "her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the\n",
      "half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly\n",
      "gravity she had never seen in him before...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever.\n",
      "As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to\n",
      "me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have\n",
      "learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places\n",
      "in my heart, that's all.  I think it was meant to be so, and would have\n",
      "come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I\n",
      "never could be patient, and so I got a heartache.  I was a boy then,\n",
      "headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my\n",
      "mistake.  For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after\n",
      "making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,\n",
      "at one time, that I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and\n",
      "tried to love you both alike.  But I couldn't, and when I saw her in\n",
      "Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once.  You both got\n",
      "into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the\n",
      "old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my\n",
      "heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you\n",
      "believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one\n",
      "another?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy\n",
      "and girl again.  The happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't\n",
      "expect it.  We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for\n",
      "playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.  I'm sure you feel\n",
      "this.  I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me.  I shall miss\n",
      "my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because\n",
      "he means to be what I hoped he would.  We can't be little playmates any\n",
      "longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another\n",
      "all our lives, won't we, Laurie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\n",
      "face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\n",
      "passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\n",
      "both.  Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming\n",
      "home to be a sad one, \"I can't make it true that you children are\n",
      "really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only\n",
      "yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair\n",
      "when you teased.  Mercy me, how time does fly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so\n",
      "like a grandma.  I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed' as Peggotty\n",
      "said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a\n",
      "precocious infant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in\n",
      "feeling, Teddy.  Women always are, and this last year has been such a\n",
      "hard one that I feel forty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Jo!  We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\n",
      "are older.  Here's a line, and there's another.  Unless you smile, your\n",
      "eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\n",
      "on it.  You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.\n",
      "What a selfish beast I've been!\" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a\n",
      "remorseful look.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone\n",
      "which she tried to make more cheerful, \"No, I had Father and Mother to\n",
      "help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you\n",
      "and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.\n",
      "I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's good for me, and...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You never shall be again,\" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,\n",
      "as if to fence out every human ill.  \"Amy and I can't get on without\n",
      "you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go\n",
      "halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and\n",
      "all be blissfully happy and friendly together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.  I begin to\n",
      "feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly\n",
      "away when you came.  You always were a comfort, Teddy,\" and Jo leaned\n",
      "her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill\n",
      "and Laurie told her to hold on to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was\n",
      "smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his\n",
      "coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and\n",
      "laughing the next.  You look a little wicked now.  What is it, Grandma?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like angels!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course, but which rules?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think\n",
      "so, it pleases her, you know.  By-and-by we shall take turns, for\n",
      "marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your\n",
      "life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind\n",
      "much.  She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.  In fact, I\n",
      "rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and\n",
      "prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you\n",
      "a favor all the while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying\n",
      "it!\" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with\n",
      "masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his \"high and\n",
      "mighty\" air, \"Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of\n",
      "man to submit to it.  My wife and I respect ourselves and one another\n",
      "too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy\n",
      "seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of that.  Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She\n",
      "is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man\n",
      "best, you remember.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She can blow him up as well as shine on him,\" laughed Laurie. \"Such a\n",
      "lecture as I got at Nice!  I give you my word it was a deal worse than\n",
      "any of your scoldings, a regular rouser.  I'll tell you all about it\n",
      "sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised\n",
      "and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and\n",
      "married the good-for-nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What baseness!  Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I look as if I needed it, don't I?\" said Laurie, getting up and\n",
      "striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the\n",
      "rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, \"Where is she? Where's my\n",
      "dear old Jo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all\n",
      "over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were\n",
      "set down to be looked at and exulted over.  Mr. Laurence, hale and\n",
      "hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign\n",
      "tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the\n",
      "old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier\n",
      "than ever.  It was good to see him beam at 'my children', as he called\n",
      "the young pair.  It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly\n",
      "duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all,\n",
      "to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying\n",
      "the pretty picture they made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own\n",
      "dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely\n",
      "eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that 'her ladyship' was altogether\n",
      "a most elegant and graceful woman.  Jo thought, as she watched the\n",
      "pair, \"How well they look together!  I was right, and Laurie has found\n",
      "the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than\n",
      "clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.\"  Mrs. March and\n",
      "her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they\n",
      "saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but\n",
      "the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a\n",
      "peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,\n",
      "prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and\n",
      "winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of\n",
      "her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for\n",
      "it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true\n",
      "gentlewoman she had hoped to become.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Love has done much for our little girl,\" said her mother softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,\" Mr.\n",
      "March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head\n",
      "beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her 'pitty aunty', but\n",
      "attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of\n",
      "delightful charms.  Demi paused to consider the new relationship before\n",
      "he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took\n",
      "the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank\n",
      "movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew\n",
      "where to have him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you\n",
      "hit me in the face.  Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,\" and\n",
      "with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew\n",
      "in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted\n",
      "his boyish soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a relishin'\n",
      "sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks\n",
      "calling little Amy 'Mis.  Laurence!'\" muttered old Hannah, who could\n",
      "not resist frequent \"peeks\" through the slide as she set the table in a\n",
      "most decidedly promiscuous manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all\n",
      "burst out together—trying to tell the history of three years in half\n",
      "an hour.  It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and\n",
      "provide refreshment—for they would have been hoarse and faint if they\n",
      "had gone on much longer.  Such a happy procession as filed away into\n",
      "the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.  Mrs.\n",
      "March as proudly leaned on the arm of 'my son'. The old gentleman took\n",
      "Jo, with a whispered, \"You must be my girl now,\" and a glance at the\n",
      "empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, \"I'll try to fill\n",
      "her place, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for\n",
      "everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at\n",
      "their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the\n",
      "opportunity.  Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad\n",
      "libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn't\n",
      "they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,\n",
      "there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human\n",
      "nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness\n",
      "of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would\n",
      "pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,\n",
      "the little sinners attached themselves to 'Dranpa', who hadn't his\n",
      "spectacles on.  Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned\n",
      "to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm.  The others paired off as\n",
      "before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless.  She did not mind\n",
      "it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver\n",
      "dishes that's stored away over yander?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,\n",
      "and wore diamonds and point lace every day.  Teddy thinks nothing too\n",
      "good for her,\" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more there is!  Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?\"\n",
      "asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care,\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\n",
      "uncongenial topic just then.  She stood a minute looking at the party\n",
      "vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last\n",
      "stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\n",
      "looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\n",
      "for even Teddy had deserted her.  If she had known what birthday gift\n",
      "was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\n",
      "herself, \"I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be\n",
      "dismal now.\"  Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her\n",
      "boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had\n",
      "just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\n",
      "come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming\n",
      "on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as\n",
      "if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,\" and the Professor\n",
      "paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, we haven't, only the family.  My sister and friends have just come\n",
      "home, and we are all very happy.  Come in, and make one of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\n",
      "away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the\n",
      "door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\n",
      "something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\n",
      "and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\n",
      "man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all.\n",
      "You haf been ill, my friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\n",
      "fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.  We have had trouble since I saw you\n",
      "last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes, I know.  My heart was sore for you when I heard that,\" and he\n",
      "shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\n",
      "comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\n",
      "warm hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a\n",
      "face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might\n",
      "as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at\n",
      "rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted\n",
      "him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for\n",
      "his own.  They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that\n",
      "opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once,\n",
      "feeling even the more friendly because he was poor.  For poverty\n",
      "enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly\n",
      "hospitable spirits.  Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a\n",
      "traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself\n",
      "at home.  The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and\n",
      "establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by\n",
      "rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch,\n",
      "with juvenile audacity.  The women telegraphed their approval to one\n",
      "another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,\n",
      "opened his choicest stores for his guest's benefit, while silent John\n",
      "listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence\n",
      "found it impossible to go to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have\n",
      "amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\n",
      "suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\n",
      "the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\n",
      "He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn\n",
      "into the circle.  For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\n",
      "and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at\n",
      "him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting\n",
      "his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.  Then his\n",
      "eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered\n",
      "the mute inquiry if she had seen it.  But Jo had her own eyes to take\n",
      "care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept\n",
      "them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water\n",
      "after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several\n",
      "propitious omens.  Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded\n",
      "expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,\n",
      "actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him\n",
      "with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment.\n",
      "Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the\n",
      "ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be\n",
      "considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when\n",
      "Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she\n",
      "watched her father's absorbed face, \"How he would enjoy having such a\n",
      "man as my Professor to talk with every day!\"  Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was\n",
      "dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a\n",
      "gentleman than ever.  His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,\n",
      "but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it\n",
      "up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect\n",
      "better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a\n",
      "Jove-like aspect.  Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she\n",
      "sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even\n",
      "the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his\n",
      "immaculate wristbands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old fellow!  He couldn't have got himself up with more care if\n",
      "he'd been going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself, and then a sudden\n",
      "thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to\n",
      "drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for\n",
      "though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor\n",
      "dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\n",
      "little blue ball.  Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\n",
      "saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\n",
      "resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted\n",
      "the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\n",
      "Laurence went home to rest.  The others sat round the fire, talking\n",
      "away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\n",
      "mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\n",
      "bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of\n",
      "matches, made a move to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\n",
      "again once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe\n",
      "and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not all there.  But no one found the words thoughtless or\n",
      "untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\n",
      "invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\n",
      "household league that love made dissoluble.  The little chair stood in\n",
      "its old place.  The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left\n",
      "unfinished when the needle grew 'so heavy', was still on its accustomed\n",
      "shelf.  The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,\n",
      "and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,\n",
      "looked down upon them, seeming to say, \"Be happy.  I am here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Play something, Amy.  Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said\n",
      "Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, \"Not\n",
      "tonight, dear.  I can't show off tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she\n",
      "sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best\n",
      "master could not have taught, and touched the listener's hearts with a\n",
      "sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her.  The\n",
      "room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last\n",
      "line of Beth's favorite hymn.  It was hard to say...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\n",
      "\n",
      "and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\n",
      "her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\"\n",
      "said Jo, before the pause grew painful.  And Mr. Bhaer cleared his\n",
      "throat with a gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo\n",
      "stood, saying...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will sing with me?  We go excellently well together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a\n",
      "grasshopper.  But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\n",
      "whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\n",
      "It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\n",
      "and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might\n",
      "listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,\n",
      "\n",
      "used to be the Professor's favorite line, for 'das land' meant Germany\n",
      "to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\n",
      "upon the words...\n",
      "\n",
      "    There, oh there, might I with thee,\n",
      "    O, my beloved, go\n",
      "\n",
      "and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\n",
      "longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\n",
      "whenever he liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered\n",
      "with laurels.  But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\n",
      "entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been\n",
      "introduced simply as 'my sister', and no one had called her by her new\n",
      "name since he came.  He forgot himself still further when Laurie said,\n",
      "in his most gracious manner, at parting...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.  Please remember that\n",
      "there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\n",
      "illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\n",
      "delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\n",
      "leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here\n",
      "some days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother's voice\n",
      "gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for Mrs. March\n",
      "was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suspect that is a wise man,\" remarked Mr. March, with placid\n",
      "satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know he is a good one,\" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as\n",
      "she wound up the clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd like him,\" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,\n",
      "and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,\n",
      "somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact.  If she had\n",
      "seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a\n",
      "severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to\n",
      "be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon\n",
      "the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the\n",
      "picture in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour?  The\n",
      "luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery,\n",
      "trying to find some things I want,\" said Laurie, coming in the next day\n",
      "to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made\n",
      "'the baby' again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly.  Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,\" and\n",
      "Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if\n",
      "asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it, but I can't get\n",
      "on without my little woman any more than a...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Weathercock can without the wind,\" suggested Jo, as he paused for a\n",
      "simile.  Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came\n",
      "home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with\n",
      "only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an\n",
      "easterly spell since I was married.  Don't know anything about the\n",
      "north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lovely weather so far.  I don't know how long it will last, but I'm\n",
      "not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship.  Come home,\n",
      "dear, and I'll find your bootjack.  I suppose that's what you are\n",
      "rummaging after among my things.  Men are so helpless, Mother,\" said\n",
      "Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?\" asked\n",
      "Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have our plans.  We don't mean to say much about them yet, because\n",
      "we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle.  I'm going\n",
      "into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove\n",
      "to him that I'm not spoiled.  I need something of the sort to keep me\n",
      "steady.  I'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\n",
      "Laurie's decision and the energy with which he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall\n",
      "astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant\n",
      "society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall\n",
      "exert over the world at large.  That's about it, isn't it, Madame\n",
      "Recamier?\" asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time will show.  Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by\n",
      "calling me names before their faces,\" answered Amy, resolving that\n",
      "there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon\n",
      "as a queen of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How happy those children seem together!\" observed Mr. March, finding\n",
      "it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple\n",
      "had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and I think it will last,\" added Mrs. March, with the restful\n",
      "expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it will.  Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\n",
      "Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\n",
      "bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, \"Mrs. Laurence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Lord!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That man intends to marry our Jo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so, don't you, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that\n",
      "expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal\n",
      "richer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love\n",
      "one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.\n",
      "Women never should marry for money...\" Amy caught herself up short as\n",
      "the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with\n",
      "malicious gravity...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend\n",
      "to do it sometimes.  If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\n",
      "duty to make a rich match.  That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\n",
      "good-for-nothing like me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that!  I forgot you were rich\n",
      "when I said 'Yes'.  I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I\n",
      "sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.\"\n",
      "And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private,\n",
      "gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\n",
      "once, do you?  It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd\n",
      "gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your\n",
      "living by rowing on the lake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I an idiot and a brute?  How could I think so, when you refused a\n",
      "richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I\n",
      "have the right?  Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to\n",
      "think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and\n",
      "though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the\n",
      "daughter was true to the mother's teaching.  I told Mamma so yesterday,\n",
      "and she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a\n",
      "million, to be spent in charity.  You are not listening to my moral\n",
      "remarks, Mrs. Laurence,\" and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an\n",
      "absent look, though fixed upon his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time.  I\n",
      "don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my\n",
      "handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is\n",
      "such a comfort to me,\" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature\n",
      "with artistic satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that\n",
      "suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his\n",
      "wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, \"May I ask you a\n",
      "question, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, you may.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's the trouble is it?  I thought there was something in the\n",
      "dimple that didn't quite suit you.  Not being a dog in the manger, but\n",
      "the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding\n",
      "with a heart as light as my heels.  Do you doubt it, my darling?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied.  Her little jealous fear\n",
      "vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't\n",

      "fellows, some of them, working like heros,  poor and friendless, but so\n",
      "full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,\n",
      "and longed to give them a right good lift.  Those are people whom it's\n",

      "youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a\n",

      "for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies.  \"Rich\n",
      "people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their\n",

      "alive, and enjoy making one's fellow creatures happy with it.  We'll\n",

      "of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert\n",
      "their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their\n",
      "elders do.  If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being\n",

      "invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with\n",
      "his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels.  The boy\n",
      "early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and\n",

      "mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for\n",

      "aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her\n",
      "brother as the one perfect being in the world.  A rosy, chubby,\n",

      "appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's\n",
      "hat on the Marches' table nearly every evening.  But he exulted in\n",
      "private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece\n",

      "of arms.\n",

      "For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like\n",
      "regularity.  Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no\n",

      "become pensive, at first, and then—alas for romance—very cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's\n",
      "nothing to me, of course, but I should think he would have come and bid\n",

      "into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, \"I beg pardon,\n",
      "ma'am,\" and looked mortally offended.  Somewhat daunted, Jo righted\n",
      "herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting\n",
      "temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the\n",
      "ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead.  The fact that a\n",
      "somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\n",

      "looking down.\n",

      "burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,\n",
      "and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We thought you had gone,\" said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read\n",

      "therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and\n",
      "manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was\n",
      "in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour.  When\n",
      "she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help\n",
      "suspecting that she had come for that express purpose.  When he offered\n",
      "her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but\n",
      "when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply\n",
      "that despair fell upon him.  On learning his good fortune she almost\n",
      "clapped her hands.  Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his\n",
      "destination, she said, \"So far away!\" in a tone of despair that lifted\n",
      "him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down\n",
      "again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the place for my errands.  Will you come in? It won't take\n",
      "long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\n",
      "particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and\n",
      "dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the\n",
      "flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of\n",
      "needles, forgot the silesia was to be 'twilled' till it was cut off,\n",
      "gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for\n",
      "lavender ribbon at the calico counter.  Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching\n",
      "her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed\n",
      "to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,\n",
      "like dreams, go by contraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more\n",
      "cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather\n",
      "enjoyed it on the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and\n",
      "haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so\n",
      "pleasant home?\" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and\n",
      "flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will we buy?\" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech,\n",
      "and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they\n",
      "went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May they haf oranges and figs?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They eat them when they can get them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you care for nuts?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hamburg grapes.  Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy\n",
      "a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done\n",
      "with it?  Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,\n",
      "and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of\n",
      "rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of\n",
      "a demijohn.  Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and\n",
      "giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they\n",
      "traveled on again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,\" began the Professor,\n",
      "after a moist promenade of half a block.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir?\" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he\n",
      "would hear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time\n",
      "remains to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden\n",
      "squeeze she gave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go\n",
      "alone.  Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had\n",
      "stepped into a refrigerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and\n",
      "the husband is such a care.  Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a\n",
      "friendly thing to take the little mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.\"  \"I'm going very fast, and he's\n",
      "getting dearer every minute,\" added Jo to herself, then with a mental\n",
      "shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to\n",
      "behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and\n",
      "then ordered out the shawls.  The clerk, being a married man,\n",
      "condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be\n",
      "shopping for their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your lady may prefer this.  It's a superior article, a most desirable\n",
      "color, quite chaste and genteel,\" he said, shaking out a comfortable\n",
      "gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?\" she asked, turning her back to him,\n",
      "and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excellently well, we will haf it,\" answered the Professor, smiling to\n",
      "himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters\n",
      "like a confirmed bargain-hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now shall we go home?\" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's late, and I'm so tired.\" Jo's voice was more pathetic than\n",
      "she knew.  For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it\n",
      "came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the\n",
      "first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and\n",
      "that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the\n",
      "latter.  Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend,\n",
      "it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.  With this\n",
      "idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty\n",
      "gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is not our omniboos,\" said the Professor, waving the loaded\n",
      "vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon.  I didn't see the name distinctly.  Never mind, I\n",
      "can walk.  I'm used to plodding in the mud,\" returned Jo, winking hard,\n",
      "because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away.\n",
      "The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he\n",
      "asked in a tone that meant a great deal, \"Heart's dearest, why do you\n",
      "cry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said\n",
      "she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine\n",
      "fib proper to the occasion.  Instead of which, that undignified\n",
      "creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, \"Because you are going\n",
      "away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!\" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp\n",
      "his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, \"Jo, I haf nothing\n",
      "but much love to gif you.  I came to see if you could care for it, and\n",
      "I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend.  Am I?\n",
      "Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?\" he added, all\n",
      "in one breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!\" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both\n",
      "hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that\n",
      "plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him,\n",
      "even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he\n",
      "carried it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had\n",
      "desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on\n",
      "account of the mud.  Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except\n",
      "figuratively, for both were full.  Much less could he indulge in tender\n",
      "remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it.  So the only\n",
      "way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an\n",
      "expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there\n",
      "actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his\n",
      "beard.  If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have\n",
      "done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a\n",
      "deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her\n",
      "bonnet a ruin.  Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most\n",
      "beautiful woman living, and she found him more \"Jove-like\" than ever,\n",
      "though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling\n",
      "thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and\n",
      "every finger of his gloves needed mending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they\n",
      "entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious\n",
      "of deepening dusk and fog.  Little they cared what anybody thought, for\n",
      "they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any\n",
      "life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the\n",
      "plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of\n",
      "heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the\n",
      "world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.  While Jo\n",
      "trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and\n",
      "wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot.  Of course, she\n",
      "was the first to speak—intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks\n",
      "which followed her impetuous \"Oh, yes!\" were not of a coherent or\n",
      "reportable character.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friedrich, why didn't you...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!\"\n",
      "cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always call you so to myself—I forgot, but I won't unless you like\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like it?  It is more sweet to me than I can tell.  Say 'thou', also,\n",
      "and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?\" asked Jo, privately thinking it a\n",
      "lovely monosyllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sentimental? Yes.  Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and\n",
      "keep ourselves young mit it.  Your English 'you' is so cold, say\n",
      "'thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me,\" pleaded Mr. Bhaer,\n",
      "more like a romantic student than a grave professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?\" asked Jo\n",
      "bashfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,\n",
      "because thou must take care of it hereafter.  See, then, my Jo—ah, the\n",
      "dear, funny little name—I had a wish to tell something the day I said\n",
      "goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to\n",
      "thee, and so I spoke not.  Wouldst thou have said 'Yes', then, if I had\n",
      "spoken?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know.  I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prut!  That I do not believe.  It was asleep till the fairy prince\n",
      "came through the wood, and waked it up.  Ah, well, 'Die erste Liebe ist\n",
      "die beste', but that I should not expect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had\n",
      "another.  Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,\"\n",
      "said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!  Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all.\n",
      "I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find,\n",
      "Professorin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like that,\" cried Jo, delighted with her new name.  \"Now tell me\n",
      "what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "under the umbrella.  It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the\n",
      "flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings,\n",
      "for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything\n",
      "but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that\n",
      "was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the\n",
      "night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and\n",
      "peace waiting to receive them, with a glad \"Welcome home!\"  Jo led her\n",

      "For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met\n",
      "occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the\n",
      "price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said.  The second year began\n",
      "rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March\n",
      "died suddenly.  But when their first sorrow was over—for they loved\n",
      "the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue—they found they had cause\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of\n",
      "money to keep it in order.  The garden and orchard alone need two or\n",
      "three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It will be an immense care for Jo,\" said Meg, stroking the head of her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Jo can do it, and be happy in it.  It's a splendid idea. Tell us all\n",
      "about it,\" cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers\n",
      "a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew you'd stand by me, sir.  Amy does too—I see it in her eyes,\n",

      "speaks.  Now, my dear people,\" continued Jo earnestly, \"just understand\n",
      "that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan.  Before\n",
      "my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no\n",
      "one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor,\n",
      "forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and\n",
      "make life jolly for them before it was too late.  I see so many going\n",
      "to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything\n",
      "for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their\n",
      "troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in\n",
      "her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not\n",
      "seen for a long while.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would\n",
      "like, and agreed to try it when we got rich.  Bless his dear heart,\n",
      "he's been doing it all his life—helping poor boys, I mean, not getting\n",
      "rich, that he'll never be.  Money doesn't stay in his pocket long\n",
      "enough to lay up any.  But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved\n",
      "me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at least I feel so, and we\n",
      "can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.\n",
      "It's just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture\n",
      "strong and plain.  There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and\n",
      "splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.\n",
      "Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?  Then Fritz could train and teach\n",
      "in his own way, and Father will help him.  I can feed and nurse and pet\n",
      "and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by.  I've always longed for\n",
      "lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and\n",
      "revel in the little dears to my heart's content.  Think what luxury—\n",
      "Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\n",
      "into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\n",
      "he'd have an apoplectic fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see anything funny,\" she said gravely, when she could be\n",
      "heard.  \"Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor\n",
      "to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is putting on airs already,\" said Laurie, who regarded the idea in\n",
      "the light of a capital joke.  \"But may I inquire how you intend to\n",
      "support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins,\n",
      "I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs.\n",
      "Bhaer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy.  Of course I shall have rich\n",
      "pupils, also—perhaps begin with such altogether.  Then, when I've got\n",
      "a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich\n",
      "people's children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've\n",
      "seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones\n",
      "pushed forward, when it's real cruelty.  Some are naughty through\n",
      "mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best\n",
      "have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they\n",
      "need most patience and kindness.  People laugh at them, and hustle them\n",
      "about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at\n",
      "once from pretty children into fine young men.  They don't complain\n",
      "much—plucky little souls—but they feel it.  I've been through\n",
      "something of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in\n",
      "such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,\n",
      "well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the\n",
      "topsy-turvy heads.  I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up\n",
      "one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll testify that you tried to do it,\" said Laurie with a grateful\n",
      "look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,\n",
      "sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying\n",
      "up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not\n",
      "merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them\n",
      "yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times.\n",
      "I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone\n",
      "feels it, though you won't let them say so.  Yes, and when I have my\n",
      "flock, I'll just point to you, and say 'There's your model, my lads'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he was,\n",
      "something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise\n",
      "made all faces turn approvingly upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, Jo, that's rather too much,\" he began, just in his old boyish\n",
      "way.  \"You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,\n",
      "except by doing my best not to disappoint you.  You have rather cast me\n",
      "off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless.  So, if\n",
      "I've got on at all, you may thank these two for it,\" and he laid one\n",
      "hand gently on his grandfather's head, and the other on Amy's golden\n",
      "one, for the three were never far apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the\n",
      "world!\" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind\n",
      "just then.  \"When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as\n",
      "the three I know and love the best.  If John and my Fritz were only\n",
      "here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,\" she added more\n",
      "quietly.  And that night when she went to her room after a blissful\n",
      "evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of\n",
      "happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed\n",
      "always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen\n",
      "in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.  Almost before she knew\n",
      "where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield.  Then\n",
      "a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished\n",
      "surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was\n",
      "continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the\n",
      "Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for\n",
      "its support.  In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,\n",
      "and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but\n",
      "the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most\n",
      "rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her\n",
      "'wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\n",
      "had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\n",

      "on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,\n",

      "now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers\n",
      "and admirers.  As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to\n",
      "increase her happiness—Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a\n",
      "happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny\n",

      "occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an\n",
      "exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance\n",
      "healthily in the veins.  The old orchard wore its holiday attire.\n",
      "Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped\n",
      "briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a\n",

      "twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree\n",
      "stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the\n",

      "a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the\n",

      "bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never\n",
      "felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad,\n",
      "galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by\n",
      "his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies\n",
      "could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and\n",
      "their own small shoes.  She knew that little Ted would turn up again in\n",
      "time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back\n",
      "with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while\n",
      "the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises.  Then Jo and\n",
      "Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the\n",
      "grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.\n",
      "The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for\n",
      "the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of\n",
      "refreshment as they liked—freedom being the sauce best beloved by the\n",
      "boyish soul.  They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the\n",
      "fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk\n",
      "while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by\n",
      "eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over\n",

      "from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the\n",

      "the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were\n",
      "transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow.  Funny presents,\n",
      "some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were\n",

      "Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to\n",
      "sing.  Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and\n",
      "from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys\n",
      "sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie\n",
      "set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best\n",
      "effect.  This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand\n",
      "success, for Mrs. March couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on\n",

      "and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Dear fellows!  It does my heart good to see them forget business and\n",
      "frolic for a day,\" answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all\n",
      "mankind.  \"Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish,\n",
      "lonely, and cold to me now.  I haven't given up the hope that I may\n",
      "write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the\n",
      "better for such experiences and illustrations as these,\" and Jo pointed\n",
      "from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the\n",
      "Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one\n",
      "of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her\n",
      "mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in\n",
      "her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face\n",
      "which never could grow old to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My castle was the most nearly realized of all.  I asked for splendid\n",
      "things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I\n",
      "had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.  I've\n",
      "got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,\" and\n",
      "Meg laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter\n",
      "it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or\n",
      "confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty.  I've\n",
      "begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing\n",
      "I've ever done.  I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so\n",
      "that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little\n",
      "angel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping\n",
      "child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little\n",
      "creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's\n",
      "sunshine.  This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for\n",
      "one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was\n",
      "growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.  Laurie was growing more\n",
      "serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth,\n",
      "good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and\n",
      "sorrow, from the most blessed for ...\n",

      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie\n",

      "lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so\n",
      "devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can't\n",

      "getting gray and stout.  I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am\n",
      "thirty.  We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night,\n",
      "for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under\n",
      "the bed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already.\n",
      "But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of,\n",
      "and never was so jolly in my life.  Excuse the remark, but living among\n",

      "\"Not half so good as yours, Mother.  Here it is, and we never can thank\n",
