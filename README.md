# Mini web scraping project- Little Women

This mini project involved the scraping of Little Women (one of my favourite books!) using beautiful soup, followed by:
(i) identifying and plotting the most frequently used words in the text 
(ii)creating a mini "auto-correct" function that returns the top 5 most similar word matches using the text as a database of words
(iii) translation of a section of text to mandarin using google API
